These ruins were used in the past by the Elves as a laboratory to research magic. These days, very dangerous monsters lurk nearby, and so Sir Collin Windawood has sealed the entrance and forbidden the common folk from coming here.<br>
However, we may teleport adventurers seeking training to just inside of the entrance. Would you like to go inside the ruins?<br>
