Stakato Nest is recommended for adventurers above <font color="LEVEL">Level 82</font>, and recently it has been known that Queen Shyeed regained her power and organized her subordinates.<br>
It's been discovered that all Stakatos in the Nest are stronger in the presence of Shyeed. But when Shyeed falls down, their power subsides as well.<br>
Also, several safe spots inside were discovered by the Golden Wool Mercenaries but they are not yet secured.<br>
Kintaijin near the entry is looking for adventurers, so please visit him when you are nearby<br>
