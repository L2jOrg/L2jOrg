Haha, I knew you were coming to find out more. Wind Kings are called <font color="LEVEL">Prochela</font>. One hero, who was lucky to return alive after meeting him, said that Procella commands the deadly <font color="LEVEL">whirlwinds</font>.<br>
Moreover, in battle, the King of Spirits creates <font color="LEVEL">multiple doubles</font>. Killing one makes the rest even meaner and more dangerous.<br>
At the mere thought of this, I have a cold skin. Maybe you want to challenge him? I know where the King of Spirits lives, and I can send you to him. If you are ready, then gather supporters and get ready for battle. I wonder what happens. But remember: Prochella is very strong and dangerous.<br1>
