This is the Garden of Eva. The strongest monsters inhabit the top levels. bronze Key Guild appointed me to head a squad and to explore local ruins. But I have already lost all my squad somehow...<br>
But I managed to find out a couple of things. Though. If you came here with your companions, I would recommend to go the room in the end of the tunnel. Or you can go straight to the top level. If you are here for the first time I will be happy to show your around.<br>
By the way, I have seen the <font color="LEVEL">Water Spirit Queen</font> here not so long ago. She was passing by not far from here and I hgazed in admiration at here movements. If you are interested I can tell you more.<br><br>
