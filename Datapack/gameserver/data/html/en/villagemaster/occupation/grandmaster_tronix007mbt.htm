Grand Master Tronix:<br>
The <font color="LEVEL">Orb of Abyss</font> is given only to those who have passed the Test of the Shillien Oracle. To take the Test of the Shillien Oracle, you should find <font color="LEVEL">Magister Sidra</font> in the Dark Elf Guild of the <font color="LEVEL">town of Gludio</font>.
