High Priestess Levian:<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Oracles</font> utilize light, life and the Spirits of Purification derived from Eva and Einhasad to advise their Elven compatriots through their close interaction with the spirit world. Rather than attack others, they use their magic to protect and heal themselves and others.<br>
Those Oracles with truly advanced spiritual abilities may become <font color="LEVEL">Elders</font>, who are able to use the most powerful White Magic by Einhasad and Eva.<br>
To become an Oracle, you must pass the Oracle test and return with a <font color="LEVEL">Leaf of Oracle</font> as proof.<br>
