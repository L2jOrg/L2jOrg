High Priest Raymond:<br>
The <font color="LEVEL">Cleric</font> is a Mystic who connected to the divine power that surrounds the world. A Cleric performs miracles through the power of the gods. Thus, the Cleric practices mostly white magic and supplementary magic to help others. However, Clerics are granted some attack skills to protect themselves.<br>
Also, Clerics have great healing powers and for this gift they are always welcomed and respected. Those Clerics who continue in their training in the service of others can attain a higher-level profession, such as <font color="LEVEL">Bishop</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Prophet</font>.<br>
But first, to become a Cleric, you must bring back the <font color="LEVEL">Mark of Faith</font> to show that your faith has been acknowledged.<br>
