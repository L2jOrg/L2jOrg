Tetrarch Asterios: <br>
Anyone wishing to become an Elven Scout must have achieved at least level 20 and passed the appropriate test.<br>
Furthermore, no character may transfer classes who hasn't gained a broader understanding of the world by leaving the forest.<br>
Follow the road south of the Elven Forest across the Neutral Zone.  When you reach the village where you need to cross a bridge, that's the Town of Gludio. Speak with <font color="LEVEL">Grand Master Rains</font> of the Warrior Guild there.  He'll help you transfer class.<br>
