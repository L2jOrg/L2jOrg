High Priest Orven:<br>
Welcome to Aden, the heart of the kingdom! People speak of this place as the kingdom's cultural and religious center, and if that's true, then it's also the apex of faith that all who serve Einhasad must preserve....<br>
True holiness can always be found in the ordinary, the everyday, the mundane. The prayer of a commoner may resonate more deeply with the mother of light than even the prayer of a high priest, so perhaps this place is not so different from other temples.<br>
