High Prefect Ladanza:
<br>Welcome to the Human city, adventurer. The Humans petitioned Pa'agrio Lord Kakai to aid them during this time of turmoil. Ancestors Martankus and Ungoat, of the Duda-Mara tribe, say that this is related to the "Eternal Winter," the only thing that can make an Orc cower in fear.<br>Hmm, it's somewhat amusing that Pa'agrio's children are here, in the castle that used to belong to our enemy.<br>
