Warehouse Keeper Pochi:<br>
Hiya! Want to deposit those items? Or maybe you want to take some items back? Well! Maybe you've been to that luxury item shop nearby? Dwarf Galladucci, an illustrious member of our tribe, is running the shop. He may be a bit weird, but he's a real fellow! Take a look there, you'll find more stuff than you can fit in your pockets! HA!<br>
