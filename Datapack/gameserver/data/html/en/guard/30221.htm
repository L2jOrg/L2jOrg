Sentinel Rayen:
<br>May the wind of the forest lead you to peace. I am the sentinel Rayen. Our duty is to drive away those who try to attack our forest and village.<br>The Elven Forest is no doubt our home. However, we have lived in the seclusion of this forest too long and I believe that living our lives isolated from the outside world has made us weak. I advise Elves who have learned the basics of sword and spell to go out beyond the forest into the land of Humans and extend their knowledge. The first gateway would be <font color="LEVEL">Gludio</font>, located to the south of the Elven Forest.<br>
