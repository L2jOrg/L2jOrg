Newbie Guide:<br>
When you target a monster, the monster's name appears in the upper central portion of the screen. <font color="LEVEL">The color of the name tells you the monster's strength</font>. Those that appear in white or sky blue have abilities equal or less than yours, while those that appear in red or yellow are stronger than you.<br>
