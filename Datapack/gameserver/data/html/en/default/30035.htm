Magister Harrys:
<br>Greetings! I... am Magister Harrys. Yes, yes, THAT Magister Harrys! As you probably know, I teach magic here in the <font color="LEVEL">Twin Temple</font>. It's such a rewarding experience to pass on my knowledge to the younger generations. To watch their minds expand! Are you here to enroll?<br>
