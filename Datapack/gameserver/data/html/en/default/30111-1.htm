And after I just warned you about the dangerous curiosity... Tut tut!<br>
Well, best you hear it from me, I suppose, rather than discover it for yourself. You have heard of the wizard named Hardin, have you not? He is a Necromancer who studies the Dark Magic prohibited by the commandments of the Ivory Tower.<br>
It corrupts its users and leads to destruction... It must be avoided like a contagion. Sadly, many capable wizards have allowed themselves to be persuaded by Hardin's parlor tricks and become his pupils. We are not safe from his influence, even here. Always be on guard!<br>
