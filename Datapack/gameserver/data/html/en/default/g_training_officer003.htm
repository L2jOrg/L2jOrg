Remember, time will continue to pass while training, so &nbsp;<font color="LEVEL">the clock is ticking on your buffs and enchants</font>. Also, items that affect XP such as &nbsp;<font color="LEVEL">Runes and Agathions </font> have no effect there.<br>The training is limited to 5 hours a day, so no need to push yourself beyond that. Also, feel free to leave and come back to fill up the rest of the 5 hours!<br><Button ALIGN=LEFT ICON=RETURN action="link g_training_officer001.htm">Back</Button></html>
