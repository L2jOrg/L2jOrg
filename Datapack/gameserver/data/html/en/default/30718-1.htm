Well... Mages are commonly described as cold figures, however in reality that is not true? Magic, at a glance, looks like a knowledge of controlling infinite power, and because of that Mages who controlled that power always feared it. But, if once a Mystic becomes arrogant, one way or another, he will get tragic damages from it. We have seen a few real examples, have we not?<br>
Mages are by no means coldhearted beings. They are rather people with radical personalities, people who can sell their souls to the devil in order to achieve what they strive for. Yes, without this personality it will be hard for one to be a successful Mystic.<br>
Me? Whew... I'm not sure...<br>
