<html><body>Blacksmith Feynn:<br>
Oh-ho! You want something from the famous Feynn?! My fame is great for business, but it can be a bit much at times... singing autographs, kissing babies, posing for paintings... I, the great Feynn, am... a... GENIUS! But I can't lend my talents to just any Tom, Drackel, or Hariss!<br>
I'm not doing any of this for free you know.. it's a dog-eat-dog world out there. Gotta ride the flame horse while it's hot!<br>
