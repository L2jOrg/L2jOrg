Trader Herbiel:<br>
Currently, our Elven studies are divided into two directions. The famous Spellsinger Adria Lumingshine travels to the Sea of Spores to conduct her studies, while Hierarch Asterios is preoccupied with neutralizing the poisons that enter our forest from the Sea of Spores. I assist the hierarch's research by collecting leaves, roots and spores of various plants and refining them.<br>
However, the hierarch has recently asked me to help his research by finding some spore pollen that was carried here by the wind from the Sea of Spores. However, these spores are so fine that it is almost impossible to find them. The only method is to extract them from the <font color="LEVEL">spore fungus</font>, a hybrid of the spores and plants of the forest.<br>
That is why I need your help. Please find me some <font color="LEVEL">spore sacs</font> from the <font color="LEVEL">spore fungus</font> of the forest. How about it? Will you take the job?<br>
