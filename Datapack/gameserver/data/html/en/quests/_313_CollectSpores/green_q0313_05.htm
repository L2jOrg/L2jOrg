Trader Herbiel:<br>
Spore fungi are found here and there within the Elven Forest. Defeat the fungi and you will be able to obtain the spore sacs. However, the spore sac may tear when the fungus is killed, and obtaining them may be more difficult than you think. The Hierarch says that <font color="LEVEL">ten spore sacs</font> are needed for his research. Good luck.
