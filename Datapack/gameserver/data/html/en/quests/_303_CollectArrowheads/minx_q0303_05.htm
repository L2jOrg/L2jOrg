Master Minia:<br>
Please gather ten arrowheads used by the lennunt orc snipers and bring them to me. I am not collecting them simply for my private purposes, but plan to donate some to Cedric's Training Hall for exhibition.<br>
Lennunt orcs are in the Elven Ruins. If you don't know how to go there, ask Guard Kenyos.
