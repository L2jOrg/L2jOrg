Ancestor Martankus:<br>
The First Orc, born of Paagrio's flame, was a very powerful being. <br>
The gods of 
wind, earth and water were jealous of his power and sought to kill him. <br>
Eventually they were successful, but not before the mighty Orc created, with his 
last dying breath, the originators of the 7 tribes. <br>
I was among them, the originator of the Hestui tribe ...<br>
We originators of the 7 tribes followed the teachings of the first Orc and worked 
hard to make our tribes prosperous. After 108 Orc tribes had taken root in this 
land we knew that our purpose was accomplished. 
We came to this cave, destroyed our exhausted bodies and left only our souls 
to watch over our descendants and test young Shamans who want to be the Lord 
of the Orcs.<br>
