Dudamara Chief Takuna:<br>
Tejakar Oroka! I am Takuna, chieftain of the Dudamara tribe! I will punish betrayers by order of the Lord of Flame.<br>
I see by your necklace that you must be a Shaman on the Examination of the Lord! Since ancient times our tribe has been known as an 'intelligent' tribe because we have produced more Shamans and clever men than any other tribe. If you want to join our tribe as a Lord, you must understand the power of our symbol, the spider totem!<br>
