Atuba Chief Varkees:<br>
Young Shaman, welcome back! I heard that you valiantly slayed those Orcs around Giran! By killing your own race I guess you have learned what the heartless fighting spirit of Atuba's totem means?<br>
Now I will give you the pointed fang totem. This means that I, the Atuba Chief Varkees, have acknowledged your skills!
