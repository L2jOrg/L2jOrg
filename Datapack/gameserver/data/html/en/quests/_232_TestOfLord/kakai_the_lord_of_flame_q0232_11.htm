Paagrio Lord Kakai:<br>
Immortal flame! The fire bestowed upon us at the beginning of the world by Paagrio! The spark that lights our temple and town, day and night! Each year, the Shaman that attempts the Trial of the Lord receives this from the ancestral spirits and comes back to create a new blaze on the torches of the temple and town! Now you have earned the right to receive the mark of the lord!<br>
I am proud of you, descendant of the courageous Orc race! May you accept the will of the ancestors to become a great ruler that leads the mighty Orc race to an honorable future! The trial has passed! Take the mark of the lord! Tejakar Oroka!
