Rosella:<br>
Elven Wizards are in the preparatory level before becoming a Spellsinger or Elemental Summoner. They aren't to be compared with the likes of the Dark Elves, who walk the path of evil.<br>
To become an Elven Wizard, you must learn how to communicate with the spirits. For this communication, you must find the four jewels that symbolize <font color="LEVEL">water, fire, wind and earth</font> and then perform a ritual. The ritual is performed to gain understanding of the basic elements that construct the world, and to receive Eva's blessing.<br>
Just recently, a young one of your age came and finished the ritual. What do you think? Will you take the challenge?<br>
