Oh... Rosella must have sent it. I've been begging her for a month to lend me this book. The love story in this book is very impressive. You may criticize a man that reads romance novels, but... Love is a truth that does not change.<br>
Hmm... Rosella has written a letter on the first page. She asks me to tell you about the <font color="LEVEL">nobility amethyst.</font> Since you gave me the book I really wanted, and since Rosella has asked me, I will tell you how to find the amethyst.<br>
To obtain the nobility amethyst you need <font color="LEVEL">two regular amethysts.</font> You can get the amethysts by killing the <font color="LEVEL">sukar wererat leaders</font> in the Elven Underground Fortress. The Underground Fortress is dangerous... Please be careful.<br>
I'll lend you this for good luck. It has always given me good luck. Return it when you have found the amethyst.
