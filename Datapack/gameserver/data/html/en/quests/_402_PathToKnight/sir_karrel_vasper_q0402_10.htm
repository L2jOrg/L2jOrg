Sir Karol Vasper:<br>
Come, comrade of the sword. You have done well. By bringing these three coins of lords, you have proven you have the abilities and qualities to become a Knight.<br>
Now, do you want to complete the trial of the esquire? If so, I will give you the sword of ritual, with which you may change your profession to a Human Knight. Of course, if you want, you need not finish the trial of the esquire, but may instead continue with your journey.<br>
