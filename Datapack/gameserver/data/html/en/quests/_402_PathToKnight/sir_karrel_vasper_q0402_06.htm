Sir Karol Vasper:<br>
Originally, Knights were warriors selected to fight against injustice and protect the helpless people. As they are given the authority to be armed with a sword and shield, they must protect the commoners from danger. As times have changed, the status of the Knight has greatly changed as well, but the fact that we are the guardians of common people remains unaltered. That is the divine duty and summons given to us by Einhasad of the light.<br>
The journey taken by young Fighters to find their calling as a Guardian of Knights is the <font color="LEVEL">trial of the esquire</font>. Esquires journey many places around the kingdom, especially into remote areas that do not receive the protection of the central army, and assist those in danger who ask for help. Those who receive help give the <font color="LEVEL">coin of lords</font> as a token of thanks.<br>
