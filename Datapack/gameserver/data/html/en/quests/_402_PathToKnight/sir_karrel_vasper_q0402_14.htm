Sir Karol Vasper:<br>
You have successfully endured a most demanding trial. Congratulations! Now you are qualified to become a Human Knight.<br>
I will give you the sword of ritual. This sword was used in the knighting ceremony of the legendary Sir Cedric -- bear it with care. If you take this to the Grand Master of the fighters guild, he will change your profession to a Human Knight.
