Tataru Zu Hestui:<br>
The Hestui Totem Spirit is the greatest entity that controls the very secret of the universe. Inscribe the language of flame that seeps into your mouth through the blood deep in your heart. The language that cannot be taught, nor recorded on scrolls, is the key to communicating with all spirits.<br>
However, you cannot command the spirits by just talking to them. In order to make the spirits tremble in fear and rule their power, you must learn the <font color="LEVEL">names of the ninety-nine spirits</font>. In order to do that, you must go to <font color="LEVEL">Gludin</font> in the Human land of Gludio. Show Seer Umos there this letter of recommendation. He will guide you to the next step.
