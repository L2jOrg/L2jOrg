Antharas Watchman Gilmore:<br>
Were they surprised to see a relic from a 1,000-year-old ancestor? Good work, my friend! Please accept this reward along with the compensation for having to travel so far.<br>
The brave soldiers who have finally obtained peace must be very grateful to you... But there are still many here in the valley who live in eternal torment. Will you continue to give them rest?<br>
