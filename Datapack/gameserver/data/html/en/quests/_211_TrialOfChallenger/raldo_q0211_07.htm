Raldo:<br>
It seems that the girl was their leader. Never mind about the common soldiers from now on. My friends took charge of the other places. You don't need to worry a bit, since they are more trustworthy people than just you. ...anyway, if it weren't for you, things could have got worse... <br>
Here, take this! It is a present from me, Battle King raldo, as an acknowledgement of your braveness. It is the <font color="LEVEL">Mark of the Challenger</font> which you have sought so hard! I will trace those scoundrels and root them out, including the one who is behind the scenes. See you again
