Trader Payne:<br>
The arrows sold in this store are specially crafted by my hands. As you know, the shaft is made from ash and the tips are made from steel or adamantium.<br>
But sometimes I get orders for custom-made arrows. Just a few days ago, Assassin Kiel Knighthawk placed an order for claw-shaped arrows made from <font color="LEVEL">wolf claws.</font> Hooked arrows made from claws are difficult to pull out once they are lodged in the body, and create great internal wounds.<br>
Kiel said that he had to leave for a castle siege soon and to complete the arrows within a week. However, time is too short and I must ask your assistance. Could you help me gather the wolf claws?<br>
