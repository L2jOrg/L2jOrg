Priest Bandellos:<br>
This case is going in the wrong direction. I think we need to send a special guard to protect her. And we'd better report this to the High Priest.<br>
I heard your story from Master Sorius. He said that you were a great help in this case and praised you a lot.<br>
In my mind as well, I think you have already proven that you are qualified. I shall give you the <font color="LEVEL">Mark of the Healer</font>. There might come a day when I shall need your help again... I hope you keep up with your practices for that day.
