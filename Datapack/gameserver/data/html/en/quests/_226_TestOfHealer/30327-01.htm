Master Sorius:<br>
I have heard from the Priest Bandellos. We will cooperate in your investigation.

What we have found out up to now is that it seems like the followers of Shilen kidnapped the girl. Meet the Dwarf called <font color="LEVEL">Dowrin Hammerkrush</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">northern part of Turek Orc Barracks</font>. He is our spy who set off ahead of us.
