Sorcerer Talbot:<br>
Welcome, my friend. You want to walk the path of the Shillien Oracle? The magic of a Dark Wizard that commands fire and wind is very spectacular, but the magic power of the Shillien Oracle, which commands the more fundamental power of the universe of light and darkness, is a valuable asset to our race. I hope you successfully complete the trial of seeking truth. <br>
<font color="LEVEL">Garmiel's Book,</font> which you search for, does not exist in this world. However, there is a way to find it.<br>
