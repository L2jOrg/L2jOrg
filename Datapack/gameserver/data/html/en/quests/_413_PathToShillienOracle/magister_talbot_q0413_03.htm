Sorcerer Talbot:<br>
I see you haven't left yet. Why are you hesitating? Hurry and go to the Dark Forest. There, <font color="LEVEL">near the School of Dark Arts</font>, there are <font color="LEVEL">dark succubi.</font> Destroy them and bring back five bloody runes. May the divine protection of Gran Kain be with you!
