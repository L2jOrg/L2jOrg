Defender Nathan:<br>
I heard about you from Mion. You're helping her collect the spider silks, right? I once learned the craft of spinning from the Golden Wheel Guild. But I gave up being a craftsman, and became a defender instead ... Actually, I once got my fortune told at the Maphr Temple. They said I wouldn't live long if I became a craftsman ... Tsk ...<br>
Anyway, my skills don't compare to a master's, but the village girls once swooned at my spinning skills! So, if you have any tarantula spinnerets, bring them to me. I'll spin an unbelievable amount of spider silk for you! <br>
