Trader Mion:<br>
I'm in trouble! I'm in big trouble! <font color="LEVEL">Van Holter</font> of Elmore came to me, Mion, and ordered twenty dresses ... Formal outfits for the mission to Aden, I heard. Oh dear. What should I do? Not enough time ... not enough materials! The honor of the Silver Scale Guild depends on my two hands now! Oh no ... I have to make the best formal wear! I'm in trouble! Big trouble! I don't know what to do now? I don't know! I really don't!<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Tarantula spider silk</font> is lighter and has better colors than the highest-quality silk! Where can I find enough tarantula spider silk for twenty dresses? That's too much! Who will believe me if I say I couldn't make spider silk dresses made of tarantula spider silk because I couldn't find enough spider silk -- I'm frustrated! I'm frustrated! Tears form in my eyes and the world collapses upon me! Yikes! <font color="LEVEL">I really don't know what to do now ...!</font><br>
