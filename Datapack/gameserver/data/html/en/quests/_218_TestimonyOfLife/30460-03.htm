Master Cardien:<br>
The <font color="LEVEL">Mother Tree</font>...Mother of all forests and Elves... The main body of the Elven tribe...

Long ago... Thanks to the sacrifice of the very first guardian, the <font color="LEVEL">Mother Tree</font> could live once again in the land filled with dead bodies. She saved the tree by killing herself and becoming one with the dying tree.

Until this day there remains her shape in the stem of the <font color="LEVEL">Mother Tree</font>. Her noble spirit which dared to sacrifice herself, and her love for the tribe... That should never be forgotten.

Thanks to her sacrifice the tree could stretch its branches high up to the sky and its roots deep into the ground and finally bloom life, once again. However... Now once more... The tree is dying...

This is a great difficulty which our lives depend on. Without the <font color="LEVEL">Mother Tree</font> we cannot exist either. To overcome this difficulty, we need the help and sacrifice of young Elves like you. Will you lend us a hand?
