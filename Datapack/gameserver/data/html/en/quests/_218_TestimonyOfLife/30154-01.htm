Hierarch Asterios:<br>

Did <font color="LEVEL">Cardien</font> send you here? It seems to me that it was only recently that you ventured from the <font color="LEVEL">Mother Tree</font> to take lessons from me, but look at you now... You have matured so much...

You must be very tired from your journey, I suggest that you drink the clear waters and feel the wind blowing from this beautiful nature and recover your strength.

So, tell me, what have you seen and felt in the kingdom of men?
