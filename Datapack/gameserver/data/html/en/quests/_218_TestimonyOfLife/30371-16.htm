Thalia:<br>
May the blessings of the starlight be with you. You have recovered <font color="LEVEL">Talin's Spear</font>! Thank you so much for your trouble.

Now that we both have the <font color="LEVEL">Grail of Purity</font> and the <font color="LEVEL">Talin's Spear</font> we can set off in search for the <font color="LEVEL">Water of Life</font>. But it is impossible without the biggest sacrifice and the greatest sorrow... 

We must pierce the <font color="LEVEL">Unicorn of Eva</font> which can be called the guardian of our forest with the <font color="LEVEL">Talin's Spear</font> and collect its <font color="LEVEL">tears</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">Grail of Purity</font>. That is the <font color="LEVEL">Water of Life</font> itself. After all, in order to recover the life of the <font color="LEVEL">Mother Tree</font>, we must deprive the life of our dearest Eva's incarnation, the unicorn...

Now do you see what you have to do? May the Goddess forgive us for our deed...
