Please, you must hurry and find <font color="LEVEL">the blade, shaft, and four jewels</font> of <font color="LEVEL">Talin's Spear</font> that were stolen from us by the <font color="LEVEL">Leto lizardman Shamans and Chiefs</font>. 

Time is of the essence. May Sayha of the winds guide your footsteps...
