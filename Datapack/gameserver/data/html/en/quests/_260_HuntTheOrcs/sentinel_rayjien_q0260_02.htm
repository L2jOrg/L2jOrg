Sentinel Rayen:<br>
The <font color="LEVEL">kaboo orcs</font> of the Fog Mountains are becoming bolder and bolder lately. Before, they wouldn't dare set foot into the Elven Forest, and now they dare to come into the village. On top of that, more and more orc hordes are invading the forest.<br>
I don't know how the orcs can come near the village, with the guardians keeping watch at the boundary of the woods. They must be avoiding the eyes of the guardians using some clever method.<br>
The elders have ordered us to recruit brothers who will help us to defeat the kaboo orcs. Shouldn't we punish this fearless race that dares to invade our homes? Would you like to participate?<br>
