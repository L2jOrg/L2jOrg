Moon Knight Jones:<br>
You can not imagine how many troubles from Ol Mahum's recently. Just a couple of days ago they attacked the convoy, which was heading to Gludio, and hid with rich booty. After that, the Aden traders sent guards to Gludio request for assistance.<br>
But the guards, as you know, can not allocate soldiers to guard because of different villains, who are waiting for the right moment to attack the town. Traders long discussed this issue, but it never could come up with. As a result, in order to <font color="LEVEL">deal with the Ol Mahum's</font>, we decided to invite mercenaries. It is unfortunate that such an important matter has to entrust a stranger...<br>
What? You are a mercenary, too?.. Haha! Well, we have met with you. Say what? Do you have a good chance to help us restore peace and prosperity in Gludin. Well, you agree?<br>
