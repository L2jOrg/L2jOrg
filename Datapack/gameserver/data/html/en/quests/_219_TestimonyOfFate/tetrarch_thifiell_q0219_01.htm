Tetrarch Thifiell:<br>
Welcome home, young brother. It seems just a few days ago when you came here after finishing your training in the shrine of Shilen. You have matured a great deal since then.<br>
The very document that you discovered this time is the 'Kaisha's Revelation' which contains the truth about Shilen's myth! It is Goddess' bible which was thought to be lost a long time ago! That document is an important clue to our suvival in the Age of Chaos, as well as a key to the opening of a new era.<br>
Now it is time for you to take the Initiation Ceremony. It is the ceremony where you share the experience and knowledge that you acquired in the Human world, as well as inheriting the accumulated knowledge of previous successors. First take this letter and amulet and go see the <font color="LEVEL">Shaman Arkenia of the Dark Elves Initiation Altar</font>. And with her help, complete the Initiation Ceremony of Shilien.
