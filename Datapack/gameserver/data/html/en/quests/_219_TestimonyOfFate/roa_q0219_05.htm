The thing that my ancestor kept with me seems to be the slip when you deposit something in the warehouse.  Perhaps my ancestor kept something precious in the warehouse? It says on the <font color="LEVEL">slip</font> <font color="LEVEL">'Gludin warehouse'</font> so you'd better go and check that place. I bet you'll be able to get some more specific information there.
