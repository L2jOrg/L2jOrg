Militiaman Leirynn:<br>
I heard that you got special missions from<font color="LEVEL">Alex</font>. I am so grateful that a stranger like you who doesn't even belong to this village is working so hard for us. I don't know exactly, but I heard that the militia is no longer starving thanks to you...<br>
When the time comes, will you let me invite you to dinner?
