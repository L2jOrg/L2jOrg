Master Luther:<br>
Did you come for the Mark of Searcher? The Mark is given to those who's ability for 'finding hidden things' is recognized. Every year, numerous Hunters, Scouts, Excavators and even some Assassins come to me in hope of receiving the <font color="LEVEL">Test of the Searcher</font>. Are you also one of them?<br>
