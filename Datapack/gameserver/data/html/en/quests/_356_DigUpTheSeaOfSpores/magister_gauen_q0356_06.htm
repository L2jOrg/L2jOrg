Your resolve is admirable! Go and get the spores that live as parasites on <font color="LEVEL">rotten trees</font> and <font color="LEVEL">spore zombies</font>. Put the spores from the spore zombies in this grey pouch and put the spores from the rotten trees in this yellow pouch. The capacity of the pouches varies according to the size of the spores. Each puch usually holds about <font color="LEVEL">100</font> spores. Thank you for your assistance.
