Oh my! The control!<br>
Hmm, I lost. Just when I thought I had won, I let a crack in my concentration... I must look like a fool to lose after all that bragging! Here, take <font color="LEVEL">my Arcana Card. Take good care of it.</font><br>
Anyway, it was a good experience. Our defeat, was an eye-opener for me as well as for Turen. Goodbye my friend. I will be looking forward to our next battle.
