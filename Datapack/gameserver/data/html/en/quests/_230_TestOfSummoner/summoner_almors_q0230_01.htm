Summoner Almors:<br>
How do you do? My name is Almors, such as I am, I am the Summoner of the Ivory Tower in Oren. Lying beside me is my partner, Pacco the cat.<br>
I am in the middle of recuperating here in my aunt's house, since the cold days in Oren worsened my conditions. Although I wish I could return to the Ivory Tower soon, to finish my project... It isn't bad at all to spend the days slowly here...<br>
On a second glance, I see that you are an apprentice Summoner! Did you come to fight a duel with me, by any chance?<br>
