High Summoner Galatea:<br>
The battle between Summoners is actually fought by the summoned creatures. The lower ranked Summoner is given the advantage of the first attack. As an apprentice Summoner, you will automatically become the 'lower ranked Summoner.'<br>
During a battle, the Summoner may assist his or her creature with magic, but cannot physically attack an opponent's summoned creature.<br>
A penalty is given if a summoner physically attacks an opponent's creature or receives the aid of another.<br>
At the conclusion of battle the defeated Summoner must surrender his or her <font color="LEVEL">'Arcana Card.'</font>  to the victor.<br>
