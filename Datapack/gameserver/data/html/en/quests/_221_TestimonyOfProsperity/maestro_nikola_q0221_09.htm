Maestro Nikola:<br>
Yes, we have finally obtained Maphr's Tablet Fragment! This is awesome. let me take a look... Hmm... Tsk. Is it so..!<br>
Well this is too hard for me to understand. It is not enough to interpret precisely just by being able to read the characters. Such a pity... after all, I guess it is impossible for us to interpret the tablet without the help of the Elders...<br>
Well done! Now deliver this to the <font color="LEVEL">Warehouse Keeper Parman</font>. This is all I have to do. I am planning to return to Shootguart after doing some more inspection on the tower.
