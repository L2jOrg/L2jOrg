Warehouse Keeper Parman:<br>
So, you have found all 4 of the vouchers? Let's take a look at them...<br>
You have brought the account book of the first elder Lockirin. Indeed, it is the suitable voucher for 'wealth'!<br>
What is this recipe for? The recipe of Emily? Is this what the woman who bore and raised 12 children, gave to you?  So this is the secret recipe for the food that is eaten traditionally in her family after giving birth to a child. It is perfect as the proof of fertility!<br>
Is the next a seed?  Yes, I can smell the scent of a matured seed. I guess it must be the seed which Maphr, the God of earth gave blessings to. Good! So what's next?<br>
Oh! Isn't this the Elven waffer! I guess it is from the Elf that lived for more than 1,000 years. It used to be a common thing to be seen, but nowadays we hardly ever get the chance to see it. It is surprising that you could get it, because the Elven waffer is known for not being sold nor given to other races.<br>
By that you have gathered the 4 Vouchers of Fertility. Congratulations! Now you have passed the first level of test! However... It is not over yet. From now on, you must take the  <font color="LEVEL">second test</font>.<br>
