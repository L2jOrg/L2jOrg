Samed:<br>
You have returned already? I see you have not found the items I asked you for. I am very disappointed ...<br>
I will explain to you again, so listen carefully. Go to the <font color="LEVEL">Ruins of Despair</font> or the <font color="LEVEL">Grim Ruins</font> and find me the <font color="LEVEL">corpse pieces</font> of the undead and I will give you an ample reward. If you don't know how to find the ruins, ask Guard Curtis or Guard Babenco.<br>
