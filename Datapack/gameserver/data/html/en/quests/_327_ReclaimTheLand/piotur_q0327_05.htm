Peter:<br>
Young soldier, you have fought well. By the contract, I will give you a reward according to the number of turek orc necklaces you have brought. Thanks to your efforts, the farmers who lost their way of living are one day closer to recovering their land.<br>
Ah! Also, do not dispose of the ancient relics that the orcs kept on them, but collect them all. You can sell them for quite a high price in the village. Why don't you think of it as a kind of bonus for the work you've done? Now that I think about it, there is supposed to be a specialist of archeology in Gludin ... That person will be able to tell you the value of these objects in more detail.<br>
