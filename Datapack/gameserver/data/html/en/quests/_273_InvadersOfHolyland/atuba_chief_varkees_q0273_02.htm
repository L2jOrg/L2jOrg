Atuba Chief Varkees:<br>
The almighty Paagrio Lord has ordered me, Varkees, to defeat these foreigners called the <font color="LEVEL">rakeclaw imps</font>! Young Orc, have you experience in fighting against the rakeclaw imps? They are magical creatures created from the power of dark magic. These blasphemous creatures are defiling our holy land even as we speak!<br>
I, Varkees, do not think that these petty creatures are brave enough to face Orcs on their own. According to the seers, a jewel called <font color="LEVEL">the soulstone</font> is embedded in the hearts of rakeclaw imps. This soulstone attaches itself to its host and steals the host's spirit, allowing dark magicians to bend the creatures to their will!<br>
The seers have revealed this truth to me, Varkees. That if we gather enough soulstones, we will be able to turn their own powers against them and find out who is controlling the imps. I, the Atuba Chief Varkees, command you! Defeat the foreigners who have invaded our holy land, and bring the soulstones embedded in their hearts!<br>
