Elder Casian:<br>
Did you know that at one time this barren wasteland was one of the most fertile places in Aden? For centuries farmers sowed their seeds and harvested abundant crops here. Ah, yes, those were the days...

But then that devil Beleth and his minions arrived. We had to come up with a resolution quickly. We were compelled to at last open the forbidden spellbook...

For two days and nights fire rained down on us and dark magic swept the land like a whirlwind... It wasn't at all what we'd anticipated...

I couldn't bear to stay in this ruined place, so I wandered the world for many years. But now I find myself drawn back, hoping to somehow restore this land to its former beauty. I shan't be able to do this alone...
