Mercenary Sophia:<br>
As I said before, our current mission is to drive out the evil spirits in this area.  However, since the main force of the mercenary troop has been dispatched to Gludio, our military force is suffering a shortage.  The only thing we are managing to do right now is to contain the evil spirits from attacking the village.  Even now, if I can find some tough skinned fighters, I am willing to hire them right away to supplement our force...!<br>
You seem like you have a lot of experience fighting evil spirits.  Someone of your caliber and experience would be easily qualified to join our mercenary troop... However, according to our policy, in order to be a member of our mercenary troop, you will still have to pass our test.  If you are interested, go see <font color="LEVEL">Captain Leopold in Gludin</font>. If you are approved by him and can bring back the Black Lion Mark, I will take you in as one of our brothers and give you the opportunity to join us in the fight.<br>
(This is a quest that can be carried out by a character of level 25 or above and in possession of the *Black Lion Mark*.)
