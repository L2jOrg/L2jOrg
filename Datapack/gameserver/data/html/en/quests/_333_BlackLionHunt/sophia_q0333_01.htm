Mercenary Sophia:<br>
As I said before, our current mission is to drive out the evil spirits in this area.  However, since the main force of the mercenary troop has been dispatched to Gludio, our military force is suffering a shortage.  The only thing we are managing to do right now is to contain the evil spirits from attacking the village.  Even now, if I can find some tough skinned fighters, I am willing to hire them right away to supplement our force...!<br>
(This is a quest that can be carried out by a character of level 25 or above and in possession of the *Black Lion Mark*.)
