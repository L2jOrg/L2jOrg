Mercenary Sophia:<br>
The enemies you will have to destroy are <font color="LEVEL">marsh stakatos, marsh stakato workers, marsh stakato soldiers and marsh stakato drones</font>. As a proof of your victory, bring me the claws of the stakatos you kill.  As always, The more proofs of victory you bring, the greater your reward will be. <br>
Now, get ready for combat and leave for the Cruma Marshlands immediately.  This time, make sure to teach those stakatos the fearful lesson of the Black Lion troop!
