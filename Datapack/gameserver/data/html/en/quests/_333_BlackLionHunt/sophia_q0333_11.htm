Mercenary Sophia:<br>
The enemies that you will have to defeat are <font color="LEVEL">ol mahum guerillas, ol mahum raiders, ol mahum snipers, ol mahum sergeants and ol mahum captains</font>.<br>
As a proof that you have defeated the enemy, bring me back the <font color="LEVEL">bloodyaxe insignia</font>, the symbol of the partisan army.  The more proofs you bring, the greater your reward will be.  Well, since you once worked under Captain Leopold, you already know the rule about proofs and rewards, don't you?<br>
Now then, hurry up and leave for the Partisan Hideaway.  Show them the wrath of the Black Lion troop to those rampaging ol mahums!
