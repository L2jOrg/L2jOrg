Paagrio Lord Kakai:<br>
Have you not left yet? Did you not say that you were going to meet those shifty Dwarves? Be careful! The only things they believe in are those things that glitter and sparkle... The trust that <font color="LEVEL">Lockirin, head of the Dwarves</font>, speaks of, may not be the trust that you believe in.
