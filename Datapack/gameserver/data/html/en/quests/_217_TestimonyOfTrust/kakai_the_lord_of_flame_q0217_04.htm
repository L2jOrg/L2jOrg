Paagrio Lord Kakai:<br>
Kakai's prediction has proven false, young Human. Take this charm and leave. This is a totem exchanged by Orc tribes when strengthening their alliances and relationships! But this is merely a symbolic gesture! This means that I will give you a chance to prove whether Humans are truly trustworthy or not.<br>
Now will you try to earn the trust of those crafty Dwarves? The only things they believe in are those things that glitter and sparkle... The trust that <font color="LEVEL">Lockirin, head of the Dwarves</font>, speaks of, may not be the trust that you believe in.
