Tetrarch Thifiell<br>
Good job, son of Human. You have been a great help for the research to free Mitraell, the tribe leader. <font color="LEVEL">Go back with this letter.</font> It is a notice indicating that we accepted the Humans' request and agreed on the need for trusting each other for the upcoming <font color="LEVEL">Chaotic Chronicle</font>. But this is just a beginning for the restoration of faith. We shall see if we could continue our trust in each other.<br>
Now go back to your King.
