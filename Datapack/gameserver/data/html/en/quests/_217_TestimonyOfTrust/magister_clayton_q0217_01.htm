Magister Clayton:<br>
I don't understand why the Tetrarch ask an outsider like you to do this such a job. But I have never doubted Tetrarch Thifiell's wisdom and have carried out the rules with loyalty. Therefore, even though I don't really feel like it, I will help you. I will tell you the materials you must get from now on.<br>
First, go to the Corridor of Death and gather the blood of <font color="LEVEL">the guardian basilisk</font>. 10 bottles of blood is just enough for a <font color="LEVEL">basilisk plasma</font>.<br>
Also, from the Wasteland, gather 10 aphids which you will be able to obtain by killing the <font color="LEVEL">soldier ants</font> If you do so, you'll be able to get the <font color="LEVEL">honeydew</font>.<br>
Last, from the Cruma marshland of Dion, catch <font color="LEVEL">the swamp stakato</font>and gather 10 bottles of their body fluids. By doing so,<font color="LEVEL">a stakato ichor </font>will be made. When these 3 things are ready bring them back to me.
