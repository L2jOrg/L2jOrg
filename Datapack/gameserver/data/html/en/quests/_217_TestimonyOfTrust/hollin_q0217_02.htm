High Priest Hollint:<br>
You will understand this better if you hear a bit of our history... Trust holds a deep meaning for the Human race. This trial will give you insight into that meaning.<br>
I am sure that you will do well.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by Human characters of level 37 and higher.)
