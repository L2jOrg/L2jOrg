Warehouse Keeper Valkon:<br>
Good! Then first take this badge. It is a mark that shows you are in the middle of performing the Trial of the Guildsman. Many Blacksmiths and Warehouse Chiefs shall help you when they see your badge.<br>
The content of the test is quite simple. It is <font color="LEVEL">making 7 Journeyman Rings</font>. It may sound simple but the process of making the ring itself is a test to estimate the Dwarf's ability and wit.<br>
Why does it have to be 7 rings? Actually... It has a symbolic meaning that you offer 1 each to the yet-to-come King of the Dwarf, and the 6 Elders of each guilds. It is a long kept tradition that was kept since the founding of the kingdom and the forming of the union.<br>
If you want to be taught the directions for making the ring, go and see <font color="LEVEL">Blacksmith Allman of Talking Island</font>. I shall write you a letter of introduction. I expect nothing in return so don't worry. When you finish making all 7 rings come and see me again. That's it!<br>
