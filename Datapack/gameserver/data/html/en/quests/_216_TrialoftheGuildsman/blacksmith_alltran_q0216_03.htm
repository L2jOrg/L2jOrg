Back in the old days I had to memorize hundreds of formulas.  Now they all have recipes!  What will they think of next?<br>
OK, here is the <font color="LEVEL">recipe for making a Journeyman Ring</font>. Let me see...<br>
[Production of Journeyman Ring]<br>
[Materials] 1 Journeyman Gem, 1 Journeyman Deco Bead, 1 Steel, 10 Varnish, 10 Grade D Crystals <br>
[Result] 1 Journeyman Ring<br>
Steel and Varnish are commonly used and easily found. Journeyman Gems and Journeyman Decon Beads are harder to find, however.<br>
