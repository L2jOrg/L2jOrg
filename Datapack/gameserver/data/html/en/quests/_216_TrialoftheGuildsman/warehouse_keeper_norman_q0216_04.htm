Warehouse Keeper Norman:<br>
Well, if you say so... At the moment I have something you can help me with.<br>
I am confronting many difficulties these days because of the gangs nearby the town. Especially the Ol Mahum theives, called Cat's Eye... I wonder what the guards are doing... Anyway, hence I am thinking of changing all the locks of the warehouse ... The locks which I have ordered has already arrived, but the keys... they aren't here yet...<br>
I ordered it from <font color="LEVEL">Duning of the Hunters' Village</font>. Will you go and get the keys for me? Here, this is the receipt.
