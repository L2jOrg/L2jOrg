Magister Mirien:<br>
Oh no! You have done well up until now but it seems that it's not yet time to face the final trial. If you go on like this you might get into real trouble. <br>
Therefore, I suggest that you come back after some more studies. When I think that you are ready, I will let you know about the next step of the trial.
