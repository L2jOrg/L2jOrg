High Priest Sylvain:<br>
While you are carrying out my task, keep this mark with you. Let's start purifying the doomed land of the execution ground. To do so, we need the <font color="LEVEL">Crystal of Purity</font>. It is a crystal made out of pure formations without any substances added into it.<br>
But this 100 percent pure gem cannot be obtained easily. The only person who can make it is <font color="LEVEL">the one and only, Marya</font> in this village. Meet her with this letter I give you. She will tell you more specifically about the Crystal of Purification.
