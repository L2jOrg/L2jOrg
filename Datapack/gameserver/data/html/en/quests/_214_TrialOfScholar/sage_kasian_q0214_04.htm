Sage Kasian<br>
Great. From now on, I shall let you know what is needed.<br>
They are<font color="LEVEL">10 pieces of Ghoul's Skin, 12 bottles of Medusa's Blood, 5 bottles of Crimson Bind's ichor, and 5 Enhanced Gargoyle Nails</font>.<br>
You can get the Ghoul's Skin from Ghoul himself. He often appears in the execution place of Dion.<br>
You can get the Medusa's Blood from the medusas that you can find in the northern part of Giran.<br>
The Crimson Bind is said to show up frequently in the Corridors of Death.<br>
Last, the Enhanced Gargoyle Nail... Among all the materials that you should find, this must be the hardest one. The Enhanced Gargoyle Nail are much stronger than any other creatures. I heard that they can be seen near the Ivory Tower of Oren.
