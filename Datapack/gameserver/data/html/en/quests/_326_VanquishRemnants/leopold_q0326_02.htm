Leopold:<br>
Currently, the Black Lion mercenaries are working for the lord of Gludio. They are in charge of getting rid of the <font color="LEVEL">remnants of ol mahum</font>, who are still staying and causing problems in this land. They have been fighting against the remnants for several months.<br>
However, ol mahums are not savages like werewolves, but highly trained soldiers. They are very difficult to deal with, since they are well organized like regular armies.<br>
A few days ago, our Black Lion troop was shamefully defeated in a close battle with ol mahums on the outskirts of Gludin. Many brothers lost their lives in combat. We are short of troops until our brothers of the second platoon, who have been dispatched to the Wastelands in the south, return. So we have decided to recruit skilled fighters to temporarily fill our troop.<br>
From the scars on your armor and the way you hold your weapon, you seem like you have had a lot of experience on the field. What do you think? Won't you fight for the Black Lions? It is an opportunity to play a role in punishing the cruel ol mahum who have ruined this land.<br>
