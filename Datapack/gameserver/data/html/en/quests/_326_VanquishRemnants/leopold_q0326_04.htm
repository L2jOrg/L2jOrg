Comrade, how is the situation on the battlefield? As you have no badge of the ol mahum in your hand, I see your performance has not been good. If you think fighting against the ol mahum is too difficult for you, you can always quit. It is better for both of us if you acknowledge your limits instead of aiming too high.<br>
If you are thinking of continuing to fight ol mahums, I will give you some advice. As I already told you, the ol mahum may seem like savage beasts, but they have an organization that has been trained as well as any country's official army. Ol mahums will help companions in danger, so you may have to face several ol mahums at once.<br>
Unless you form a troop like them, you have no choice but to approach them carefully and use guerilla tactics to deal with them one at a time. Knights may say it is a dishonorable way to fight, but it's quite an effective method.<br>
