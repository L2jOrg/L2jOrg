You heathens who believe in the Goddess of destruction. Or should I rather call you this way?... 'The children of Shilen'... Perhaps the mysterious incidents that happened one after another recently, has to do with them!<br>
Hurry and go to Giran! If what Brankel told us is true, the Breka Orcs must have the black egg delivered to them, so you'd better go and search that area. Is this all the Hunter's Rune that Brankel left? There might be more of them so search for them as well. <br>
First, go to the <font color="LEVEL">Giran Castle Town</font> and meet the <font color="LEVEL">Prefect Vokian</font>. He has a debt to pay me, so I bet he will help you. An Orc's job must be done by an Orc. Please ask him about the Breka Orcs.
