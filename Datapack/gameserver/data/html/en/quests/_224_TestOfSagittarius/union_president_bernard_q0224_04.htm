Union President Bernard:<br>
Hmm... OK, give it a try. First go and meet <font color="LEVEL">Hamil of Floran Village</font>. He is originally from Innadril, and an archery genius who received the title of Sagittarius at the age of 20. Many an archer older than he received lessons from him.<br>
Ha ha! To tell you the truth, it is more important for you to win Hamil's acknowledgement rather than mine for the test. Take this letter of introduction. Then Hamil will tell you the task you must perform. Good luck, young man. May the joy of the chase and the rewards of the hunt be with you!
