Nice to meet you young Warrior. Did Bernard send you here? We were just in need of some help. I'm glad that you came.<br>
Right now, in the southern part of the kingdom, something unusual is going on. The wasteland ants are making some movement and from the east, the Breka Orcs are... Moreover, they say that something weird is happening up in the Cruma Tower. The Dwarves are all whispering about it... That the 'thing' has awoken from underneath the tower...<br>
I think that this is only a tip of the iceberg. I believe there is more to come, something even bigger.... Although that is the least thing I would hope for... If only we can find Brankel, we could have some more precise information... <br>
