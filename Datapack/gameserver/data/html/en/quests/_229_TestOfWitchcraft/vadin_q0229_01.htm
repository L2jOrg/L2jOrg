Priest Vadin:<br>
Why are you trying to use the Sword of Binding? The drevanul, Zeruel? I never heard of such monster. But I can tell from your desperate look that you are not telling a lie. I shall give you a trial. If you complete this, I will approve that your resolution and faith are firm, and give you the permission by the church. <br>
Listen carefully. Recently the number of pilgrims who are visiting the great shrine of Aden is growing day by day. Likewise, those wicked Orcs who are trying to take advantage of the pilgrims are gathering also. The <font color="LEVEL">Tamlin Orcs</font> of southern Aden are such people. Kill them and bring <font color="LEVEL">20 Tamlin Orc Amulets</font> as a proof. This is the trial that the shrine invests you.
