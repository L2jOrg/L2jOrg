Orim of the Shadow:<br>
Anyone who ever owned the jewels all turned into horrible 'undead'? It must be because the power of Black magic dwelling in the jewel drains the life energy of the owner...<br>
Normally, one would throw away or destroy the jewel in such occasion, but it is strange that the owners would never let go of the jewel. I suspect that there must be some mysterious bewildering spell on it... Or else it might have some kind of will affecting it...<br>
Perhaps the subject of the will might be related to the secret of this box. There's no way we can find out unless we open it. All we need to do now, is insert the jewels in each hole according to its order. Now! Give the jewels to me!<br>
