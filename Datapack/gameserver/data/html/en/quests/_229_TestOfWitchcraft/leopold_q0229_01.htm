Leopold:<br>
Nice to meet you, traveler. I am Leopold, Commander of the third platoon of the Black Lion mercenaries.<br>
Our troops are as dignified and courageous as any other Knights on this continent. Last summer when the drakes poured out of the The Valley of Dragons, we were the ones that defended Castle Giran and a few months ago when the pirates of Avella attacked Heiness the floating city, it was also the Black Lions who defeated them.<br>
These days we are battling against the Turek oak people of the northwestern part of Gludio at the request of farmer Peter.<br>
