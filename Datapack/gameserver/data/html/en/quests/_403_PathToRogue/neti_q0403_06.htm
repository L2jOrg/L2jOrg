Have you come already? I see you are far from finishing.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Hurry on to the Ruins of Despair, and hunt the skeletons and spartoi. You must use the bow and dagger that I gave you. If you bring back ten bone pieces as proof of your success, I will let you pass the test. </font><br>
If you don't know the way to the two ruins, ask the guards. Well, you should leave now. Good luck!
