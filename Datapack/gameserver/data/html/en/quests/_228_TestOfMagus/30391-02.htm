Parina:<br>
The <font color="LEVEL">singing flower</font> is an legendary malignant spirit which is said to sing in order to bloom flowers. Its appearance is that of a beautiful lady but in fact it is a very horrible creature. They shoot out from a seed called <font color="LEVEL">the Golden Seed</font>.

It is not so romantic as it may sound. For the singing flower is said to seduce people with its beautiful voice, only to feed on the blood of its preys...

I am also consulting <font color="LEVEL">Casian</font> the Wise about this matter at the moment so why don't you go and meet him with my letter. He is in the <font color="LEVEL">Wastelands</font> right now.
