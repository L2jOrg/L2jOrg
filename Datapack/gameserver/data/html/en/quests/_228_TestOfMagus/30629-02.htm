Bard Rukal:<br>
To see a Mage combining the songs of the spirits while commanding elemental magic is like hearing a song straight from heaven.

A Mystic must have a thorough understanding of the elements of tone. Come back 
when you have more experience.

(Quest for Wizard, Elven Wizard, or Dark Wizard. Level 39 or above.)
