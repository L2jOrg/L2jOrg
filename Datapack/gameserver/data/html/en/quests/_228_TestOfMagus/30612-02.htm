Wiseman Casian:<br>
The <font color="LEVEL">singing flowers</font> are said to root their <font color="LEVEL">golden seed</font> near waterfalls or lakes, and seduce the stunned people with their beautiful voice. Two different kinds of singing flowers would never bloom close to each other.

</font>Perina</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Rukal</font>... and I investigated its location and we managed to agree on a few places. Those places are, the <font color="LEVEL">Fellmere Lake in Gludio</font>, the waterfalls near the <font color="LEVEL">Ivory Tower of Oren</font>, and somewhere in the southern part of <font color="LEVEL">Giran Castle Town</font>. 

Did you get it? The <font color="LEVEL">singing flowers</font> are bound to gather around the watery areas by its nature. Therefore, look around the 3 places that I had mentioned, and especially the watersides, lakes... are the places you need to pay good attention to. Take this amulet just in case. The <font color="LEVEL">singing flowers</font> all possess small amounts of poison... This will help you.
