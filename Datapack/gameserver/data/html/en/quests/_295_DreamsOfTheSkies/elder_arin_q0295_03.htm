Elder Arin:<br>
Floating stones are not as hard to find as you think. Have you seen creatures such as monster eyes and magical weavers? They can fly through the air because they have floating stones in their bodies. Maybe the scholars were correct when they said monster eyes were artificial creatures created by the giants of ere.<br>
Anyway, there are many <font color="LEVEL">magical weavers</font> in the Spine Mine Field, so you should hunt them and collect <font color="LEVEL">floating stones</font>. If you collect and bring <font color="LEVEL">fifty</font> floating stones, I will reward you.
