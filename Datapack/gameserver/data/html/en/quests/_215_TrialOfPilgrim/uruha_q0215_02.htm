Uruha:<br>
Ah! That arrogant and reckless follower of Eva! Can't you see? Isn't it evident the indecisiveness of Eva who is under the authority of our Goddess Shilen? The followers are no different! <br>
I will give you this book. I hope it will help you to recognize the truth, and keep away from being contaminated by the reckless stupidity of Eva's followers.
