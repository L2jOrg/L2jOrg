Seer Tanapi:<br>
That is quite a surprise! So you say that you felt the flames of Paagrio? Amazing!<br>
To tell the truth, I didn't expect much from you when I sent you to the Cave of Trials. A young man like you these days... I shall remember this.<br>
So now you want to learn about the Maphr? Then go and see <font color="LEVEL">Gauri Twinklerock of the Dwarven Village</font>! I hope that you will find the light of truth at the end of your journey! Tejakar Paagrio!
