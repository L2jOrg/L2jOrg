Priest Potter:<br>
So you want to learn properly about the Einhasad? Hmm... Is that so? That's why you came to such a remote island...<br>
In fact, the reason why I came here in the first place, was because I incurred the hatred of the High Priests while I was trying to clarify the truth too specifically. Anyway, I prefer the liberal atmosphere here rather than the sickening center body.<br>
...I have so much to tell you. But before that, I have a favor to ask you...Please get rid of the <font color="LEVEL">malignant spirit Nahir</font> coiling in the <font color="LEVEL">Elven Ruins</font>. This is also related to what you are trying to learn. Please, will you do my favor?
