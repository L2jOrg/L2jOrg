Sage Kasian<br>
I don't understand why Humans like to distinguish between right and wrong concerning Gods so much... Among them, the Priests are the maniacs... There is no reason for us to commit crimes if we express and act according to our feelings. Don't you think so? After all we are God's creations... Therefore, even though we commit any crime, it's God's fault, not ours.<br>
This is all I have to say. Now I would like you to return to <font color="LEVEL">Hermit Santiago</font> who initiated this pilgrimage in the first place.
