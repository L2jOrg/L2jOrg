Seer Manakia:<br>
That was magnificent, young shaman! You have swept the medusas clear out and won back the remains of great hero!<br>
But I am so sorry that our forefather's remains are in such wretched condition! I have no face to see our ancestor's spirit! We are to blame for abandoning our forefather's spirit! I, Seer Manakia shall readjust <font color="LEVEL">Hermodt's Remains</font>, to a well-preserved shape!<br>
Thou, young man of Orc, even when you pass the Test and become a higher level shaman, never forget! The spirits of our great heroes! The glory of our forefathers who fought for the tribe!
