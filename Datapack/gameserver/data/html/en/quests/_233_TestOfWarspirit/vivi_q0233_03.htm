Priestess Vyvyan:<br>
Kiruna and Gelhaas were 2 Warriors who fought bravely against the army of the devil, Beleth. Their army won every battle, but then one day, Gelhaas was killed by the evil spirits of Beleth. Imagine Kiruna's sorrow when she heard the news that her lover was killed. A few days after the incident took place, it is said that she went to the battlefield with her lips tightly sealed and won a great victory over the army of Beleth.<br>
But unfortunately, in the final battle Kiruna was wounded deeply. She was removed to the shrine for remedy, but in the end she died and was buried beside Gelhaas. Some say that she refused to be treated herself...<br>
Sometimes, the feelings which you call as a sign of weak-mindedness, can be the source of powerfulness. Can't you see...? <br>
