Mason:<br>
I am no longer strong enough to even lift up a simple spear. But my hatred and will to seek revenge for those who killed my family is burning like mad. I beg you. Please seek revenge for me. When you bring me back <font color="LEVEL">100 heads of the bloody X bodyguards</font> then I'll be able to die in peace.<br>
Those Ol Mahums are staying in the <font color="LEVEL">northern part of Oren</font>. You will be able to find their army post when you move farther north from the Corridor of Death of Kiran.
