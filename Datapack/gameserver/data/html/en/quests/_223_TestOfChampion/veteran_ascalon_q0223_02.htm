Veteran Ascalon:<br>
Would you like to hear about my splendid past? When I was young I used to be hired as a soldier. Back in those days I wandered around freely and fought against the alien army and made love with foreign women. There were times when things seemed to be too harsh, but even then, my blazing spirits as a Warrior never burned low. The flaming friendship among comrades, struggles, fierce battles, love and romance, I experienced them all. We were true Warriors.<br>
But I am too old now. If I find a talented young fellow who will succeed me, I would like to retire in peace. If only you can enhance your skills a bit more, you could be the one to succeed me. What do you think? Will you come back to me after you have improved your skills?<br>
(Quest for Warriors and Orc Marauders, level 39 and above.)
