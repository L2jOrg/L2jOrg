Captain Mouen:<br>
Ascalon was my teacher when I was young. He used to be a good soldier, but he is too old these days, and often lets his mind astray. In other words, age has begun to tell on him... But to me he is like a father, and I can't oppose what he says. Nowadays he is caught in self delusion and keeps saying that he himself is the only one who can save the kingdom from its enemies. That's why I worry sick about him...<br>
