Master Terry:<br>
Then listen carefully to what I say from now on. You and I, we each have some tasks to do. While I am off to somewhere, I want you to investigate the mutations one by one.<br>
They are <font color="LEVEL">Ol Mahum Captain</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Turek Orc Overlord</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Ant Captain</font>, and <font color="LEVEL">Turek Bugbear Warrior</font>... That's it. I bet they'll also have a bezoar planted in each of their bodies.<br>
The problem is that these creatures that I had mentioned are all very offensive. Perhaps it might be the bezoars that make them so offensive.<br>
But, if it were you, I think you could manage it... Do you need more information?<br>
