Trainer Terry:<br>
I think you are sufficiently prepared now. I will tell you about the next task. Being contaminated by a Dark Bezoar is something to worry about; however, according to Marina's research, the contamination seems to be limited to only a few creatures. I want you to be in charge of getting rid of those hosts.<br>
Marsh stakato drones, Breka Orc overlords, noble ant leaders, and Leto lizardmen warriors are on the list. Of course, these creatures all have tendencies to be aggressive. Extract the Dark Bezoars from their bodies.<br>
Do you know where you can find them?<br>
