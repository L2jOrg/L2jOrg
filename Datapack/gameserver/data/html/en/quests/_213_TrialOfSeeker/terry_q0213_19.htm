Trainer Terry:<br>
Marsh Stakato Drones can easily be found in the swamps of northern Dion. It is a dangerous monster, so be careful. In particular, when they are in a group, try to avoid attacking them from a close distance, and lure them to another place before fighting them.<br>
You have already seen many Breka Orc Overlords, yes? The same goes for them. When they are in a group, do not attack them first.<br>
The Ant Warrior Captains can be found in the Wastelands and the Ant's Nests. I presume you have already seen them when you went to hunt the Ant Captain? He's a very fierce one.<br>
The Leto Lizardmen Warrior is the one you must be most careful of. He is the most dangerous of them all, and may be too strong for you yet. But we don't have much time. I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to take the risk, and do your best, though it is a tough task. If you have friends that you can trust, it would be good to go with them.<br>
Good luck to you, then!
