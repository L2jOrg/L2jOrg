Sir Aaron Tanford:<br>
After all, the unfortunate Knight wasn't able to recover his dignity. All that is left for him is this tears of regret. What an intensive curse. So is it his fate to wander around the Wastelands like that forever?... But he can't blame anyone else but himself.<br>
Well done! You have completed my assignment successfully. However this is not the end of it. Now you must go to the <font color="LEVEL">Dark Elven Guild in Dion Castle Town</font> and meet <font color="LEVEL">Sir Kiel Knighthawk</font>. He will be waiting for you with your second task. By all means I hope that you complete the rest of your tasks successfully. I shall pray to Einhasad for your brilliance.
