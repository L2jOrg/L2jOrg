Sir Kiel Nighthawk:<br>
The very report that Sir Talianus couldn't deliver to the King until the end... When you meet his spirit and promise him that you will deliver the report to the King of Aden, he will finally be able to rest in peace. His spirits are now captured in the doomed tree of the execution ground. Take the <font color="LEVEL">Mirror of Orpic</font> with you. There is power dwelling in this mirror which enables you to see the spirits of the dead. Go to the execution ground and get rid of the <font color="LEVEL">hanged man ripper</font> who is suppressing the spirits of him. Then you shall be able to confront the ghost of Sir Talianus.
