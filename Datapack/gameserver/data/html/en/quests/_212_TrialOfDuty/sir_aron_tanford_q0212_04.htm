Sir Aaron Tanford:<br>
If you want to know about the second level of the trial, go and meet  <font color="LEVEL">Sir Kiel Knighthawk</font>. He is in the <font color="LEVEL">Dark Elven Guild of Dion Castle Town</font>. By all means I hope that you complete the rest of your tasks successfully. I shall pray to Einhasad for your brilliance.
