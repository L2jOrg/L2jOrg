Sir Kiel Nighthawk:<br>
It is just as I had explained before. There are no changes. Kill the <font color="LEVEL">strains</font> and the <font color="LEVEL">ghouls</font> to collect the <font color="LEVEL">torn pieces of the report</font>. When you gather all the pieces and complete the report of <font color="LEVEL">Sir Talianus</font>, bring it back to me. Period.
