Priestess Rupino:<br>
What brought you here? You are a man of faith, like me... Do you have any problems? Are you worrying about the higher level in faith, by any chance?

...Sorry to say, but I think it's a bit early for you to have such worries... While you sincerely follow the path of faith, there will come a point when you shall face a barrier. That is when you should seek me.

(Quest available only for Clerics or Shilien Oracles of level 39 and higher.)
