Priestess Rupino:<br>
In the church, we teach nonresistance, peace and sacrifice. But sometimes I can't help questioning myself, if following their lessons are only short term good deeds. The world out there is full of evil and yet we are sitting here in the shrine doing nothing but praying, training, giving remedies and almsgiving...

Sometimes I think that.... I wish I could make a better world, where good people can live in peace... With the help of the power of light which Einhasad granted us...

Oh my... I talked too much. Forget what I said until now. The High Priest once scolded me for having too radical thoughts. You must be careful since others may take you as a heretic.
