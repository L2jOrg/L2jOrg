Preacher Sla:<br>
Easier said than done, eh?... Do you realize how 'heretical' your words were? If the high people from the shrine heard you, I bet you'd be tied to the stake by now...

I believe that it is Einhasad's will that you are here. As a matter of fact, there is something that you can help me with.

Actually, my disciples are performing missionary work for the warriors of Grecia. They are having a hard time with those bad tempered Ol Mahums. I want you to go and help them. The person in charge of the missionary is called 'Katari'. You'll be able to meet her near the waterfalls of the Neutral Zone.
