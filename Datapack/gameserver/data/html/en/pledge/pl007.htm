  <body>If a clan is requested for disbanding, the clan gets disbanded.
    <br> You can cancel disbanding through a clan recovery request within 1 week. Once it's canceled, you cannot request for disbanding again within 7 days.
    <br>If a clan disbanding is requested, the clan lord will lose Exp equivalent to his death. Realistically the clan lord cannot form a clan again for 10 days once the clan gets disbanded.
    <br> Please note that any items left in the clan warehouse will disappear when a clan gets disbanded.
