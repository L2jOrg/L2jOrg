<br>Have you heard of the crystals that contain the desires of spirits? They've been appearing in various places throughout Aden, and the sages and blacksmiths discovered that they can be used to increase the level and grade of equipment.
<br>I learned from the sages how to bring out the power from the crystals, and I'm able to use it to upgrade equipment.
<br>Various materials are required to upgrade, and it must already be enhanced.<br>
