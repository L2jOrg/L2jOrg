<br>Equipment upgrade is available for rare items as well as normal weapons, armor, and accessories. You can only upgrade enchanted items, and you need the necessary materials.
<br1>Keep in mind that for all upgrades (excluding rare upgrades), weapons must be enchanted at least to <font color="00FFFF">+12</font>, armor to <font color="00FFFF">+10</font>, and accessories to <font color="00FFFF">+8</font>.
<br>Also remember that each upgrade type has a certain chance to fail and that you cannot upgrade weapons with Augment or Rune effects.
<br>Remember that for gloves, boots, and helmets of B-grade and above, upgrades are only possible when the armor is sealed.
<br>Lastly, the items you obtain through the special armor upgrade are always sealed.
