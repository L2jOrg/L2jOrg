<html><body>Grand Master Ramos:<br>
Hail and well met, my friend! Welcome to Gludin Harbor Village; I am Grand Master Ramos. Ah, don't let the fancy title worry you. Young adventurers like yourself all remind me of my own younger brothers. Undoubtedly you've already heard of me, eh? I don't like to boast, but it's no secret that in this village I am admired by men and adored by women. You seem a likely enough lad... I imagine that you could be like me if you're willing to put in enough effort. Ha ha!<br>
