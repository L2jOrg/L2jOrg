<html><body>Add Sub class:<br>
Unfortunately, you are not eligible to discuss sub class.<br>
In order to add a sub class, you must meet some necessary qualifications.<br>
First, <font color="LEVEL">you should complete the "Seeds of Chaos" quest</font>. For more information about this quest, visit Hierarch Kekropus in Kamael Village.<br>
You should complete the "Fate's Whisper" quest before embarking on the "Seeds of Chaos" quest, however. You can receive this quest from Maestro Reorin, who lives in a hut east of the Town of Oren.<br>
Second, <font color="LEVEL">you should have a profession for your second or third transfer, and each level of sub class should be above 75</font>. If your profession is Berserker and you have Soultaker as sub class, for example, each of two must be above 75 in order to add a second sub class.<br>
Third, <font color="LEVEL">if you are an Arbalester, Berserker and Soul Breaker, the road to a third sub class will be open</font>. Experience it for yourself!
