<font color="LEVEL">Antidote</font><br>
If you spread an ointment made from Dead Spider's Ichor mixed with Moonstoone Beast's Scales on a wound, the bleeding will stop instantly, but it is going to itch a lot. To avoid this, we can try to add some Antidote to the medicine.<br>
I was ptomised to get it from the Town of Gludio, but my Antidote was stolen on the way by <font color="LEVEL">Ratman Scavengers</font>.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Thorn from Trimden's Limb</font>
Trimdens' Thorns are hollow inside, that's why they make great syringes. I think it's more effective to inject a medicine into a body, rather than spread it on the skin.<br>
Slay <font color="LEVEL">Trimdens</font> and bring back their thickest limbs.<br><br>
