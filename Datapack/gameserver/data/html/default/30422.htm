<html><body>Abyssal Celebrant Kalinta:<br>
I welcome you in the name of Shilen. There are those who do not like Shilen, since she's the goddess of death. Some even think of her as the devil, and refer to their followers as pagans.<br>
But all living things die eventually. No matter how afraid they are or try to avoid her, once they die, they'll rest by her side. Everyone's equal in the face of death.<br>
