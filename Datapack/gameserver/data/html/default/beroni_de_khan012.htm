<br>You want to know about the dolls that crossed the force field? Well, they aren't ordinary dolls. They have the power of bosses, so do not underestimate them! 
<br>You can obtain a Sealed Doll of Border, and you can use a time-limited sealed doll to obtain a permanent boss doll or higher level boss doll.
<br>There are Queen Ant, Orfen, Baium, and Frintezza Dolls. I'll pray that you can acquire the doll you wish covet.
