Hey... YOU! Yes you<br>
What are you doing? I am in charge of the guild here in Hunter's Village. Pay attention.<br>
There are 3 things you must remember while in Hunter's Village. 1), whether people or prey, judge no one based on their appearance; 2) go to the hunting grounds only with trusted comrades; and 3) always obey my commands without hesitation. That is the most important precept!<br>
