Glad to meet you! My name's Aren. Do you like this village? It is a lovely place, isn't it? Noce sceneries, friendly people... But don't let them fool you!<br>
The first impression might be misleading. I've been living here for a long time. Believe me, the village is far from what it looks like. If you want to stay alive, you have to grow some eyes in the back of your head.<br>
