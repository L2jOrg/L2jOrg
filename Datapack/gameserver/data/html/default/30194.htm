For all my travels and experiences, there is one thing I still cannot figure out. Why does even the slightest mention of Dark Magic send Humnas into tizzy fits?<br>
They have no trouble killing each other with sword and spear, no scruples about plotting and scheming....<br>
So what's with the extreme reaction? There must be more to it. Maybe it's some type of reverse psycholory? Perhaps they're actually studying Dark Magic, but they don't want the rest of us to know? Heh. That makes sense. I wouldn't be surpised if the Ivory Tower even has a secret Dark Arts facility.<br>
