Our guild is the largest and powerful of the six guilds that define Dwarven society. We boast of a tradition of nearly one thousand years as a prestigious union of famous traders and powerful bankers. Our guild runs warehouses in almost every city of the continent.<br>
We do not pay heed to the boundaries drawn by Humans! Wherever there are customers -- from the snowy fields of Lansk to the faraway land of Cardiff across the ocean -- we do business with the all who want to trade! That is the spirit of independence embodied by our Steel Door Guild.<br>
