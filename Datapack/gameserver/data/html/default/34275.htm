Ah, where did my elder brother go? The block under the anvil is about to break apart - it has to be replaced. But I cannot make it by my self.<br>
Apparently, you are here to enchant a weapon... But do you know that enchantment is?<br>
An <font color="LEVEL">enchantment</font> endows a weapon with a special power.<br>
Care to know what you need for an enchantment? There is nothing simpler than that. Bring me a <font color="LEVEL">Life Stone</font> and some other necessary items and put them on the anvil.<br>
Oh, and one more thing... The anvil is quite old... Haw haw! So, failures might occur during work...<br>
However, of all the Artisans of Black Anvil only my brother and I can help you.<br>
So, if you would like to enchant a weapon, you have to address us. Haw!<br>
By the way! Once a weapon is enchanted, you cannot craft a dualsword.<br>
If you need particularly a dualsword, craft it first and then proceed to the enchantment process.
