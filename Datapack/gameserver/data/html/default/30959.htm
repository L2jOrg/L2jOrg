<html><body>Musician Barbabo:<br>
Welcome, you fresh-faced traveler! I am a musician. an artisan of melodies. Music is the finest blessing bestowed upon us by Eva, the goddess of art. When you're feeling blue, as I sometimes do, nothing cheers you up like a cheerful tune played on the accordion! It will lighten the darkest mood!<br>
