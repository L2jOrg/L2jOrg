It is said that long ago the Fairy King Obelius and his people hid themselves deep within the Fairy Forest, away from the savagery and bloodthirsty nature of the Humans. It is also said that Fairies are even longer-lived than the Elves.<br>
It that if even perhaps the Fairies still exist, waiting for their chance to avenge so many years of suffering and fear....<br>
I wonder If even now they influence events. Perhaps what we call madness is merely the Fairies poisoning the minds of those they deem their oppressor.<br>
Ah! Forgive my musings, my friend.<br>
