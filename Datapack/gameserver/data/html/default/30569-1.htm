The Cave of Trials is also called the Founder's Cave. It is a sacred place created by the founder of our race, and it houses the remains of our ancestors.<br>
In the beginning, great <font color="LEVEL">Pa'agrio</font> used the seeds of fire to create our race. But the other gods feared our power, and ther joined forces to kill our creator. They drowned the Eternal Flame with water, the wind scattered the ashes of his body, and the earth covered every last trace of him.<br>
