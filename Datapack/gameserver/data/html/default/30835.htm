<html><body>Lich King Icarus:<br>
A new face in our midst! How refreshing! We get a bit tired of seeing the same old faces day after day. And I can tell from the way you stand that you're going to be full of insteresting surpises.<br>
Oh, how rude of me, I'm Icarus. Pleased to meet you. You may have heard of me, I'm one of the 13 Lich Kings who once shook the Elmoreden Empire to its core! Those were glorious day! But now, It's just me.<br>
