<html><body>Master Martien:<br>
Nice to meet you, my young friend! My name is Martien. I am the security manager of the Traders' Guild of Giran.<br>
Traders work hard to accumulate wealth, but as in all professions, there are some who prey on the profits of others. It is especially true in places such as this, the center of the continent's economy. Bugbear pillagers, Orc gangs, ratmen thives... My hired security forces barely have time to sleep, as they must protect the traders from those hooligans both day and night.<br>
