Welcome, traveler. This fortress is where the great siege battle occurred during the bloody wars between the Elves and Dark Elves. Many young Elves met their doom here.<br>
I have been thinking deeply about fate, love and war over here, since traveling the Elven Forest. May I ask you? Are you interested in stories about fate and love? How about a tragic love story I read a few days ago?<br>
