<html><body>Marius:<br>
I am Marius Graymist. Originally, I am from the Elven Forest, but I have served as a knight under <font color="LEVEL">Baron Waldner</font> or Gludio for the past 30 years. I fought with the Baron's royal guards in the war against Elmore and the assault of Gracia.<br>
However, I have retired and am living quietly in this secluded place. I write poetry and music, and stydu history as a hobby ... blood-stained Human history ...<br>
