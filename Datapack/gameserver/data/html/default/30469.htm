Greeting, traveler. I am Jonas, a cook from Giran. I have come to participate in the <font color="LEVEL">cooking contest</font> that is to be held here.<br>
This cooking contest holds a great significance for me. Traditionally, the men of my family have taken the path of the knight, but I refused that tradition and chose the way of the cook. From childhood I had no skill with the swrod, but loved cooking more than anything else.<br>
But my father could not understand. I was overwhelmed with frustration, and in my anger, declared that I would rather attain fame by becoming the greatest cook in all the land rather than a country knight that no once acknowledges, and then I left home. Since then, I've worked for more than ten years under many famous, chefs, learning their arts.<br>
I am determined to do well in this contest, and receive acknowledgement as a chef. That is the only way I will ever be able to face my family again.<br>
