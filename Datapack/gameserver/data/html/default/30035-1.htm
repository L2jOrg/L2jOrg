Ah, forgive my oversight. Priest Poster is in fact my twin brother. Unlike me, he is calm and quiet. You wanted to know why it's called the Twin Temple means, right? I'm not sure if you know, but both Yohanes and Baulo, and Poster and I, are twins. Perhaps it is only a coincidance, but because of 2 sets of twin brothers teaching here, people began refering to this temple as the Twin Temple.<br>
Don't tell Priest Viotin! He will think people are being disrespectful. Any more question?<br>
