Hardin? I've known his for years. But even after all that time, I don't suppose I can say I really known him well. Often he wanders off suddenly, leaving this Academy virtually empty. Where he goes and what he does, I have no idea. No doubt something that would shock and amaze you....<br>
In terms of behavior, he always appears to act politely, even honorable. But don't be fooled. A man like him always believes he is above any law, any code of ethics, any "civilized" standard of behavior.<br>
