<html><body>Magister Baulro:<br>
Yohanes, the priest of this place, is my twin brother. When we were young, we were expected to follow in the footsteps of our father, who was bishop. But I became fascinated by the power of magic, and opted to cecome a magister instead. I will be forever grateful to my brother for encouraging me to find my own path, even over the objections of my parents and family. He was a wise and compassionate man, even then.<br>
