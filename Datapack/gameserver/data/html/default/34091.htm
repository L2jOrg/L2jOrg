Sora:<br>
I came across a room by chance. There was a terrifying Steward holding the key, managing that place.<br>
Inside that toom, there was the ancient Pirate Captain Golberg. Just like the legend, he was super big and scary. It will be hard to deal with him by yourself.<br>
If you got the <font color=LEVEL>Golberg's Room Key</font> from the <font color=LEVEL>Steward</font>, I will send you there.<br>
