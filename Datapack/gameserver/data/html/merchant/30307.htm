<html><body>Blacksmith Karrod:<br>
Elven craftsmen have grat skill, without question, but they also tend to be stubborn and elitist. They won't even touch any other metal but mithril! Now, there's no question that mithril is an excellent material: very light, stronger than steel and possesses a high affinity for magic.<br>
But I refuse to be bound by foolish tradition, so I've been researching how to process various other materials. I've already learned the augmenting methods for Adamantite and Damascus, and I've recently begun studying processing methods of Oriharukon.<br>
