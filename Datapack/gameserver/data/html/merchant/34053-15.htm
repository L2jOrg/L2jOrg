<font color="LEVEL">Characteristics</font> are skill types that raise spirits' strength. Each time a spirit levels up, it gains <font color="LEVEL">Characteristics Points</font> and its strength increases when the Characteristic Points are added to each ability.<br>
When you evolve spirits, the highest possible level for the Characteristic increases, so evolution is essential.<br>
It is possible to reset at any time, so do not worry and add Characteristics however you see fit.<br>
