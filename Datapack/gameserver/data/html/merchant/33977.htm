<br>There are so many strange things about the Material Realm. Apparently we need Adena just to get some clothes! So I've asked Zephyra to help me create items of value so that the Ertheia can make some Adena. The research was very hard, but it was worth it!
<br>Iâ€™ll help you obtain special items with the skill I learned. But you know that in order to get something special you need materials that are just as special, right?
