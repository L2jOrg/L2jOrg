Each Spirit can grow up to 10 levels.<br>
Also, it is possible to evolve spirits that have completed growth.<br>
When spirits evolve, they increase strength an return to level 1, allowing them to grow them to Level 10 again.<br>
Don't forget that you need an <font color="LEVEL">Evolution Stone</font> to evolve Spirits.<br>

<font color="LEVEL">(To evolve Spirits must reach Level 10 at 100%, so they require the ingredients for evoution from the Evolution Stone.)</font> <br>
