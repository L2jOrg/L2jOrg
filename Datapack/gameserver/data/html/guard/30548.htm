<html><body>Defender Nathan:<br>
I see that the Spine Mountains are already covered with snow.... It makes me realize how we Dwarves are just a small part of much larger universe!<br>
Go ahead, take a good look at the mountains... Don't wealth and fame seem insignificant now?<br>
Oh, I should introduce myself! I'm Nathan, a Defender of this village. I must stand guard no matter how cold the winter gets!<br>
