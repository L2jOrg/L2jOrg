I have never been to the Death Pass. I heard it is a long and dangerous road,because of the monsters that come out from the Dragon Valley. If you want to know about the Death Pass, you should ask my partner, <font color="FFFF00">Zerome</font>. He recently returned from making a patrol of that place.<br>
