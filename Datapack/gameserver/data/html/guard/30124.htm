<html><body>Guard Zerome:<br>
I recently went on patrol in <font color="FFFF00">Death Pass</font>. I saw harpies and medusas flying around at the time. It would have been impossible for a normal person to get back alive. They look like beautiful women from afar, but when you get up close they are actually very ferocious monsters. But now, the monsters before me are even more ferocious and frightening. I'm more worried about the village than about my life.<br>
