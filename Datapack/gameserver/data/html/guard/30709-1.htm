You will find Dragon Valley south of the village. To reach the entrance of the valley you must go by Hardin's Academy and go west.<br>
Dragon Valley got its name from the legend that dragons come to the valley to die. But there is one dragon whom death does not threaten. He is the most feared green dragon Antharas. He has no fear althrough surrounded by the graves of his brethren.<br>
Many adventures have attempted to slay this dragon, and all have perished.<br>
