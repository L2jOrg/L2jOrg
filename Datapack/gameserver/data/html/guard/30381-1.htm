Long ago, Orc tribes lived freely in Gludio. When we Humans came to this place we drove them out. As of yet there have been no reprisals for our actions. But now they are under the sway of a new chief, Burai, and the situation has changed. They now occupy the fertile farmaland located in northwest Gludio and are staging a sit-in! Truly, I do sympathize with their cause, but this act of aggression cannot to unanswered. We have sent too many years cultivating that farmland.....<br>
Under normal circumstances we would send in the army, but obviously, these are anything but normal circumstances! Still, something must be done!<br>
