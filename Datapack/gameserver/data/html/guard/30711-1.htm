Have you ever seen a unicorn? It is very dignified and exquisite creature. Unicorn and may other beautiful creatures live in the Enchanted Valley. The scenery of the valley is quite bewitching and mysterious. There are certain plans that only grow there. Mystic legends say that fairies live in the deepest part of the valley, hidden there to avoid being hunted by Men.... I pray they are never found....<br>
