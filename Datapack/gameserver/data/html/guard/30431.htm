<html><body>Sentinel Eriel:<br>
May the whisper of the wind give your heart peace. I am Sentinel Eriel. I watch the Neutral Zone so that the wicked Dark Elves don't break our peace agreement and invade our forest.<br>
You will enter the Neutral Zone as soon as you cross the bridge. If you go south along the road you will reach <font color="LEVEL">the Town of Gludio.</font> It is the closest Human village to the Elven Forest.<br>
