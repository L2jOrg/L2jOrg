Hello, traveler. I am Nasign. Captain Raigen over there and  I are in charge of guarding this bridge.<br1>
Welcome to our Hunter's Village.<br>
The hunters here are a little bit different from those elsewhere so please be careful not to offend anyone. If a problem occurred, it would be very humiliating for us.<br>
