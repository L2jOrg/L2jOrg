Really? So I guess you're not from around here? All right then, I'll explain it to you. Hmm, well, there was a monster called the Earth Wyrm Tasken deep in the eastern mountains. They say that it was a devil created by Shilen, but I wouldn't know about that.<br>
Anyway, the Dwarves were busy mining for Mithril, and they accidentally reached the nest of the Wyrm. Well, it was a big disaster.We thought we Dwarves would be wiped out. But all of a sudden, this Dwarvescalled Lucien shows up. He was so great! He had a one-on-one fight with the Earth Wyrm. Hoo, must have been quite a sight. Anyway, Lucien's been the hero of Dwarves ever since. He's no longer living, of course, but there are statues of him all over. Ahh .... I want to be like Lucien.....<br>
