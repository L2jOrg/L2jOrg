<html><body>Sentinel Knight Alberius:<br>
Guardians are the guardian spirits of the forest. When the goddess Einhasad created the Elves from the leaves of the Mother Tree, she also created the guardians to protect the forest which would be the Elves' home. Theye are still loyal to their first purpose, and are very hostile to other races that invade the forest. Even Elves, if they injure their own kind, are dealt with ferociously.<br>
