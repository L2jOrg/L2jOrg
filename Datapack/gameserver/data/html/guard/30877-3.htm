Nothing special, just the babbling of idiots. Long ago when Shilen went to war against Einhasad and lost, for some reason, the gods didn't kill her. Instead, they chose to seal her there....<br>
The book called the Scriptures of the Seal details seven methods of releasing the seal of Shilen. This is much more than the seven ghost stories told to schoolchilren...<br>
If that depraved god is set free, the people living in this land will surely die. Do you imagine that the seal would have been placed so carelessly? Obviously, this is just the useless talk of an idiot. And if is so easy to free Shilen, the corrupt goddess would have already resurrected long ago.... Do you think she would still be sleeping if she had any chouice? Am I right?<br>
