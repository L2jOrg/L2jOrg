I suppose you're using the weapons and armor you were issued by the Priest of Pa'agrio. That's unless you have rich friends, of course, eh?<br>
For now, whatever you have will do. After defeating monsters, you'll often find armor they left behind. Sometimes weapons,too. If you're lucky, you may get your hand on <font color="LEVEL">Cloth Shoes,</font> <font color="LEVEL">Apprentice's Shoes,</font> <font color="LEVEL">or a Cloth Cap.</font> as hunting spoils.<br>
You should have been given two weapons, a Squire's Sword and Training Gloves. Even a novice like you can tell the different between a sword and a brawling weapon, I think. The <font color="LEVEL">Training Gloves (hand-to-hand weapon)</font> hit twice as often as other weapons, but they're not as powerful a shield. Plus, you need both hands, so forget about a shield. Now the <font color="LEVEL">Squire's Sword (one-handed sword)</font> is much slower than the Gloves, but is more accurate and does more damage. Remember that different weapons may call upon different skills in their use. Either is a worthy weapon -- it is up to decide which suits you best.<br>
