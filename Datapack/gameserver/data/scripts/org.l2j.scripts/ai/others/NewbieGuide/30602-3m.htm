<html><body>Newbie Guide:<br>
We Orcs are born fighters, and nobody expects a Mystic like yourself to give up the fun of real fighting. That's why you can choose to hunt mainly with magic, or to fight with a combination of weapons and magic. Either way is fine, it's all up to you.<br>
If you wish to concentrate on magic, use the Apprentice's Staff until Lv.5; by then you should be able to save 1,000 Adena for an <font color="LEVEL">Apprentice's Rod.</font> If you want to stick with weapons, buy a <font color="LEVEL">Short Sword.</font> You might get better armor from the monsters you kill, but that's a matter of luck, so if you're over Lv.5 and you still don't have gloves, shoes or a helmet, you might want to think about buying the cheapest ones the store offers.<br>
