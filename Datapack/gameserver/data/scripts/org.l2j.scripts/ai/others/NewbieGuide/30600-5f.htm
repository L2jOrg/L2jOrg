Now, pay attention; you'll need <font color="LEVEL">SP</font> to gain your skills. SP is short for <font color="LEVEL">"skill points",</font> and they're earned along with experience whenever you defeat a monster. SP are deducted whenever you learn a new skill. You can check your SP by clicking the <font color="LEVEL">Character Status</font> button, then on the <font color="LEVEL">Status</font> tab in the window. Of course, the number of SP you need will vary, depending on the skill you're after.<br>
