/**
 * Scripts added in the custom folder define quests and/or AI that are not normally part of the original Lineage 2 game.<br>
 * In addition, "custom" is sometimes used as a temporary implementation of aspects of the original game that are not yet fully implementable by L2J.<br>
 * In this manner, partially accurate emulation may be offered until a better method is implemented.<br>
 * The mechanics and syntax of custom scripts are the same as all quest scripts.
