To be a Spellhowler, your level must be over 40 and you need to collect the Mark of the Scholar, the Mark of Fate, and the Mark of the Magus.<br>
You did collect all of the marks, but your level is not high enough. Come back to me after more training. Then I will change your occupation to a Spellhowler.
