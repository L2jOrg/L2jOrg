<html><body>Priest of the Earth Zimenf:<br>
Frankly speaking, it's because of me that Priest Gerald needs help. I asked him to clean Maphr's statue, but as soon as he picked it up, it slipped from his hands and broke into pieces. I heard Priest Daichir gave Gerald a tongue-lashing... He ordered to repair the statue within a week.<br>
I'm afraid if Gerald fails to do it, then Priest Daichir will think up a severe punishment for him.<br>
