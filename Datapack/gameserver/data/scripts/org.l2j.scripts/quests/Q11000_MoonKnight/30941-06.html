Oh, you have brought me 10 Orc Invader Heads! Wonderful!<br>
But that is just a start! Turek Orcs are going to pay for cheating us! Now my fearless warriors will put their new armor on and attack Turek Orc Barracks!<br>
And you go to Gludin and tell something to the people over there. Tell them that this time to great! Ol Mahums warriors are merciful and will not take their lives! But one day we shall raze Gludin to the ground, so be prepared!
