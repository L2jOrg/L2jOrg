You cannot imagine how much trouble are Ol Mahums causing lately. Just a few days ago they have attacked caravan coming to Gludio and took a good loot. Traders of Aden asked Gludio guards for help after this.<br>
But the guards cannot spare any warriors to guard the caravans because of all the bandits which are always waiting for the right moment to attack the city. Traders discussed the matter a lot but could not think of anything. So they have decided to use mercenaries to<font color="LEVEL"> deal with Ol Mahums</font>. It is a shame that we have to ask outsiders to deal with such an important problem...<br>
What? Are you a mercenary too?... Ha, it is good that we met then. So, what do you say? You have a chance to help us bring peace and prosperity back to Gludin. Will you agree to help?<br>
