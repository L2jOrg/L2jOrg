You did it well. Thanks to you we have broken the plans of our enemies. In addition to that, Ol Mahums and Turek Orcs are enemies now. I could not even dream about this. All thanks to you. Sometimes one warrior can archieve more than a whole army... Looks like you are this warrior.<br>
You are going to be properly rewarded. That is the decision of Gludio Guards. This reward is our gratitude for all your efforts.<br>
You can pick one <font color="LEVEL">Armor Set</font>. Just one, so choose carefuly.<br>
