What did Neti tell you? <font color="LEVEL">Trader Rolento</font>? It is the Dwarf running the store in the <font color="LEVEL">Southern Entrance to the Wasteland</font>. So he is the one who signed this Armor Trade Contract?<br>
I always thought him a suspicious man. I mean, such a weird place for the store... So he did that on purpose: to get rid of the guards and sign a contract with our enemy.<br>
Find Rolento, show him the contract and question him. When he admits to signing the contract with Turek Orcs I will send my soldiers to arrest him!
