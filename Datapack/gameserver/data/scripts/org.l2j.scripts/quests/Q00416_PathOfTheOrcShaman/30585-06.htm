To master the authority of flame and truly govern the spirits, you must learn 2 things. First, you must learn the language of flame, which is the language of the spirits, in order to communicate with them. Second, you must learn the names of the 99 spirits in order to acquire power over them. Unless you accomplish both tasks, you cannot become a true Orc Shaman.<br>
