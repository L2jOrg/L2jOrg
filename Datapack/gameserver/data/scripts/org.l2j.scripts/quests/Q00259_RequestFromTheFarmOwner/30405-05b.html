Ah, you're new to soulshots, are you? Well by all means, let me explain! A soulshot enhances a weapon by encircling it with a blue spirit. This greatly improves the attack power of the weapon. The enhancement is consumed with use. Continuous attack will require multiple soulshots. Mercenaries and hunters are known to carry hundreds of soulshots as part of their equipment.<br>
It is very important to remember that soulshots can only be applied only to a weapon that has been specifically designed to absorb spirit energy. The grade of the weapon and the type of soulshot used determine the outcome. Know your weapon and select the appropriate soulshot.
