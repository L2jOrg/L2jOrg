Aren't you Spiron's messenger? What business do you have with me? Hmm? What is this Contract?<br>
Oh no. Those goblins ...! I told them to tear this Contract to pieces and throw it away ... This puts me in quite a difficult situation ... However ... Why did you bring this Contract to me?<br>
Oh ... Now I understand ... If I give you the proper price, you will forget about this Contract, right? You are as cunning as that old man ... Ok. Is this enough? Not enough? Now, this should be enough. You are a greedy one ...<br>
Give me the Contract now! I will throw this into the brazier in the forge tonight ...!
