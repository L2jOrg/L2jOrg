Hey, why did you give up so easy?<br>
It doesn't matter whether I belong to the Gray Pillar guild or not, does it?<br>
All six guilds are closely related and share collaborative relationships with each other.  I even know some Collectors who work in Blacksmith Shops!  Then, it shouldn't be so strange for me to give the test of an Artisan, right?<br>
