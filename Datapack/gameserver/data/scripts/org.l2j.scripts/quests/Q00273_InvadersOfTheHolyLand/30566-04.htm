Tejakar Pa'agrio! Then go at once and <font color="LEVEL">defeat the Rakeclaw Imps, collect their Soulstones and return here to me!</font> I, Varkees, pledge to reward you for every Soulstones you bring.<br>
But listen well! Although the Soulstones are originally red, they turn black when they assimilate with the host. Most of the Soulstones you find will have already turned black, but some of the stronger-willed Imps may still have Red Soulstones. Bring me a <font color="LEVEL">Red Soulstone</font> and I will give you an even greater reward!
