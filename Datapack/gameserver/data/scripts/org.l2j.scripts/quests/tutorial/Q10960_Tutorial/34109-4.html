<html><head><body>Elder Lukenir:
<br>Jin Kamaels were created by the Giants, but we escaped to not live for the Giants.
<br>A long time passed since we started living in seclusion, and the world has changed. Now we can live as a race of our own.
<br>We erased the pain of the past as you awoke from the deep sleep, but if you remember anything painful, don't dwell on it, and enjoy the new life.
<br>You no longer need to come to this place. Go out into the world. I'll send you to the Newbie Guide. Experience all there is to life.
