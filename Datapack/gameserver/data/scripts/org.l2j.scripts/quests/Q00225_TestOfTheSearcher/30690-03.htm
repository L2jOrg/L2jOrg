Have you come for the Mark of the Searcher? This mark is reserved for those with recognized detection skills. Every year, many Hunters, Scouts, Excavators and even some Assassins come to me in hope of taking the <font color="LEVEL">Test of the Searcher</font>. Is this what you seek?<br>
<Button ALIGN=LEFT ICON="NORMAL" action="bypass -h Quest Q00225_TestOfTheSearcher ACCEPT">Say that you will take the Test of the Searcher</Button>.
