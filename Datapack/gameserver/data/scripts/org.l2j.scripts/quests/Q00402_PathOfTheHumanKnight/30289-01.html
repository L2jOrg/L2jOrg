May the blessings of Einhasad be with you always.<br>
Long ago the knights alliance protected the church of Einhasad. Not many know this, but in the chaos that followed the fall of the empire, it was that very alliance that protected the church from raiders and pagans, while still protecting the priests from the armies of Beleth. We never forgot the assistance we received from them over those dark, desperate days.<br>
