<html><body>High Priest Raymond:<br>
Even now, I can hear the cries and groans of despair from my priest brothers who cannot find rest. Please bring me <font color="LEVEL">twelve Silver Crosses of Einhasad</font> from the Undead Priests at the Ruins of Despair, which is to the south of the village, so that I may offer a service to appease their souls.<br>
May Einhasad's blessing be with you.
