Well done. I will reward you for every piece of proof you have brought me. This is a reward given to honor the fighters who have faithfully carried out the will of our lord.<br>
The lord's decree is still valid. There is still more Adena left for rewards. Will you continue your hunt, or will you quit?<br>
