<html><body>Duelist Kaien:<br>
I am too tired to count.  I will trust that you completed the assignment so far.  You did well, but I would have been able to complete this task in a single day. The Duelist's Trial is not yet over, so do not get ahead of  yourself.<br>
The hard part begins now. Are you ready to attempt the <font color="LEVEL">final trial</font>?<br>
