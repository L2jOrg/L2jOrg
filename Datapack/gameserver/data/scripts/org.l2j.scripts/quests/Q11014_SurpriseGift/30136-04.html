Excellent! Can you feel how well it fits? I hope it will protect you during your adventures.<br>
By the way, I have a request for you. I'm designing a new model of shield together with Grocer Vollodos, and we plan to put in on sale. I worked on the structural design, and Vollodos promised to come up with ideas for decoration and reinforce the finished product, but there haven't been any news from him for a while. Could you visit him and ask about his progress?<br>
