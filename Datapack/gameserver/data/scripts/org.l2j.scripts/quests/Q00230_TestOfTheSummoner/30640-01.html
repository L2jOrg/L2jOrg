<html><body>Summoner Brynthea:<br>
Welcome, apprentice Summoner!  My name is Brynthea.  I am a Summoner like you. Let me introduce my lovely creature, Tilfo.<br>
You are here to challenge us, correct? Here is my Arcana Card... Hand-made by a Dwarven slave. Exquisite, isn't it? You shall have it if you defeat me, although that is highly unlikely. ...Is there something you want to say?<br>
