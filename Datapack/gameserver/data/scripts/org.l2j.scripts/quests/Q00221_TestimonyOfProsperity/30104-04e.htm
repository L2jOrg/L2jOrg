<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Parman:<br>
As you know, Maphr is the god of the Dwarves, the god of riches. For Dwarves, the acquisition of riches is a means by which we win favor with Maphr. Ah, but you must first learn the true meaning of <font color="LEVEL">richness</font>. This is the first part of your test.<br>
You must find the <font color="LEVEL">4 meanings of richness</font> before you can go on. Traditionally, richness has connotations of wealth, fruitful lands, fertility and health.<br>
Take this ring with you so other guild members will recognize you and help you with this test. Bring me proof of all 4 meanings and Maphr will be pleased.<br>
Also take this <font color="LEVEL">Dimensional Diamond</font>, which you can exchange with the village Gatekeeper for special items or services. I know it will help you on your journey.<br>
