Foreign traveler, do not wander around this place. Please conduct your business in the village quickly and leave. Soon, our Dark Elven Race will go to war with the balor orcs of the Misty Mountains.<br>
When the fighting begins, the roads will become dangerous and you may be forced to stay here. So if you have somewhere else you need to get to, it would be better to hurry.<br>
(Quest for Dark Elven characters.)
