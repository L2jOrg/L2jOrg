You want to take the Sword?<br>
Well, if you like close combat, then this Sword will be a great choice.<br>
Have you heard something about the battle that happened in the dungeon recently? I think you know. There has been many talks about it. One of Sentinels named Starden took part in that battle. I heard a rumor that he thinks about going back to the dungeon. Could you ask him about it?<br>
