The Scholar is qualified to teach the highest-level magic. <br>
<font color="LEVEL">The Scholar's Trial</font> determines if one is qualified for this responsibility.  If you choose to advance your learning, you must pass this trial. However, at this time I don't think that you are ready.  As the great Magician Akenias said, "There is a right time for all learning."<br>
