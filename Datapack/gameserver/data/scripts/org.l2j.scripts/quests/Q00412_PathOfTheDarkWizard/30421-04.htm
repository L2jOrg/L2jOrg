I see you already have the Jewel of Darkness. That means you are qualified to become a Dark Wizard. Take the jewel and go to a Grand Master of the Dark Elf Guild in Gludio.<br>
The closest is the village of Gludin. Follow the road and continue on south. Go to the Dark Elf Guild there and meet <font color="LEVEL">Grand Master Xenos</font>. He will change your profession to Dark Wizard.
