<html><body>Weapon Merchant Reep:<br>
Lately thieves have been stealing packages that I send to my customers. Our shop-"The Golden Wheel"- has just opened. These thefts might lead us into banckruptcy. Could you slay Goblins and Orcs who hang around the trade route? Here's the <font color="LEVEL">Bounty Poster</font> for these wretches. I think they are to blame for all of this. I hope you can help us.<br>
