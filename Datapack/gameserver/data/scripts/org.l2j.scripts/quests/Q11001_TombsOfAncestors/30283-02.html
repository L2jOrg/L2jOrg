Oh! You finished earlier than I'd thought. You taught these beasts a good lesson. They will never approach our tombs again!<br>
I have a nice reward for you. Make your choicea sword or a scepter? If you engage in close combat more often, I suggest you take a sword. If you're more into magic, take the scepter.<br>
