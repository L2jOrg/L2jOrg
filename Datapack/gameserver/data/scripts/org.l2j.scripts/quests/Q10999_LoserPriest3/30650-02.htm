<html><body>Head Priest of the Earth Gerald:<br>
I'm so embarrassed... I thought I couldn't craft yhe cleaning tools on my own, and I was just about to spend temple's charity donations on materials. But then I had to drop this idea. priest Daichir would have never forgiven me, not until the day that I die.<br>
Here, take the <font color="LEVEL">New Cleaning Tool's Supply List</font>. A dusting brush can be made from <font color="LEVEL">Bat Bristles</font>. You will also need <font color="LEVEL">Trimden web</font>, which is perfect for making a rag, and <font color="LEVEL">Kerope Werewolf's Twig Charms </font>for a twig broom. I will use these materials for crafting the cleaning tools. I hope you can help us.<br>
