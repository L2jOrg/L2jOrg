<html><body>Class description - Elven Oracle:<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Elven Oracles</font> can perform holy miracles by the power of their faith. The Godess favors them....<br>
They are the Key Class for a group game since they specialize in healing and reinforcing with various Buffs..<br>
They are ill-suited for a single-player game since they barely have any attacking magic Skills. Hunting will be most effective in a group game..<br>
