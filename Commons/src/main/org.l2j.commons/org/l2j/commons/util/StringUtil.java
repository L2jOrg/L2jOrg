/**
 * String utilities optimized for the best performance.<br>
 * <h1>How to Use It</h1>
 * <h2>concat() or append()</h2> If concatenating strings<br>
 * in single call, use StringUtil.concat(), otherwise use StringUtil.append()<br>
 * and its variants.<br>
 * <br>
 * <h2>Minimum Calls</h2><br>
 * Bad:
 *
 * <pre>
 * final StringBuilder sbString = new StringBuilder();
 * StringUtil.append(sbString, &quot;text 1&quot;, String.valueOf(npcId));
 * StringUtil.append(&quot;text 2&quot;);
 * </pre>
 *
 * Good:
 *
 * <pre>
 * final StringBuilder sbString = new StringBuilder();
 * StringUtil.append(sbString, &quot;text 1&quot;, String.valueOf(npcId), &quot;text 2&quot;);
 * </pre>
 *
 * Why?<br/>
 * Because the less calls you do, the less memory re-allocations have to be done<br>
 * so the whole text fits into the memory and less array copy tasks has to be<br>
 * performed. So if using less calls, less memory is used and string concatenation is faster.<br>
 * <br>
 * <h2>Size Hints for Loops</h2><br>
 * Bad:
 *
 * <pre>
 * final StringBuilder sbString = new StringBuilder();
 * StringUtil.append(sbString, &quot;header start&quot;, someText, &quot;header end&quot;);
 * for (int i = 0; i &lt; 50; i++)
 * {
 * 	StringUtil.append(sbString, &quot;text 1&quot;, stringArray[i], &quot;text 2&quot;);
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Good:
 *
 * <pre>
 * final StringBuilder sbString = StringUtil.startAppend(1300, &quot;header start&quot;, someText, &quot;header end&quot;);
 * for (int i = 0; i &lt; 50; i++)
 * {
 * 	StringUtil.append(sbString, &quot;text 1&quot;, stringArray[i], &quot;text 2&quot;);
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Why?<br/>
 * When using StringUtil.append(), memory is only allocated to fit in the strings in method argument. So on each loop new memory for the string has to be allocated and old string has to be copied to the new string. With size hint, even if the size hint is above the needed memory, memory is saved
 * because new memory has not to be allocated on each cycle. Also it is much faster if no string copy tasks has to be performed. So if concatenating strings in a loop, count approximately the size and set it as the hint for the string builder size. It's better to make the size hint little bit larger
 * rather than smaller.<br/>
 * In case there is no text appended before the cycle, just use <code>new
 * StringBuilder(1300)</code>.<br>
 * <br>
 * <h2>Concatenation and Constants</h2><br>
 * Bad:
 *
 * <pre>
 * StringUtil.concat(&quot;text 1 &quot;, &quot;text 2&quot;, String.valueOf(npcId));
 * </pre>
 *
 * Good:
 *
 * <pre>
 * StringUtil.concat(&quot;text 1 &quot; + &quot;text 2&quot;, String.valueOf(npcId));
 * </pre>
 *
 * or
 *
 * <pre>
 * StringUtil.concat(&quot;text 1 text 2&quot;, String.valueOf(npcId));
 * </pre>
 *
 * Why?<br/>
 * It saves some cycles when determining size of memory that needs to be allocated because less strings are passed to concat() method. But do not use + for concatenation of non-constant strings, that degrades performance and makes extra memory allocations needed.<br>
 * <h2>Concatenation and Constant Variables</h2> Bad:
 *
 * <pre>
 * String glue = &quot;some glue&quot;;
 * StringUtil.concat(&quot;text 1&quot;, glue, &quot;text 2&quot;, glue, String.valueOf(npcId));
 * </pre>
 *
 * Good:
 *
 * <pre>
 * final String glue = &quot;some glue&quot;;
 * StringUtil.concat(&quot;text 1&quot; + glue + &quot;text2&quot; + glue, String.valueOf(npcId));
 * </pre>
 *
 * Why? Because when using <code>final</code> keyword, the <code>glue</code> is marked as constant string and compiler treats it as a constant string so it is able to create string "text1some gluetext2some glue" during the compilation. But this only works in case the value is known at compilation
 * time, so this cannot be used for cases like <code>final String objectIdString =
 * String.valueOf(getObjectId)</code>.<br>
 * <br>
 * <h2>StringBuilder Reuse</h2><br>
 * Bad:
 *
 * <pre>
 * final StringBuilder sbString1 = new StringBuilder();
 * StringUtil.append(sbString1, &quot;text 1&quot;, String.valueOf(npcId), &quot;text 2&quot;);
 * ... // output of sbString1, it is no more needed
 * final StringBuilder sbString2 = new StringBuilder();
 * StringUtil.append(sbString2, &quot;text 3&quot;, String.valueOf(npcId), &quot;text 4&quot;);
 * </pre>
 *
 * Good:
 *
 * <pre>
 * final StringBuilder sbString = new StringBuilder();
 * StringUtil.append(sbString, &quot;text 1&quot;, String.valueOf(npcId), &quot;text 2&quot;);
 * ... // output of sbString, it is no more needed
 * sbString.setLength(0);
 * StringUtil.append(sbString, &quot;text 3&quot;, String.valueOf(npcId), &quot;text 4&quot;);
 * </pre>
 *
 * Why?</br>
 * In first case, new memory has to be allocated for the second string. In second case already allocated memory is reused, but only in case the new string is not longer than the previously allocated string. Anyway, the second way is better because the string either fits in the memory and some memory
 * is saved, or it does not fit in the memory, and in that case it works as in the first case.
 * <h2>Primitives to Strings</h2> To convert primitives to string, use String.valueOf().<br>
 * <br>
 * <h2>How much faster is it?</h2><br>
 * Here are some results of my tests. Count is number of strings concatenated. Don't take the numbers as 100% true as the numbers are affected by other programs running on my computer at the same time. Anyway, from the results it is obvious that using StringBuilder with predefined size is the
 * fastest (and also most memory efficient) solution. It is about 5 times faster when concatenating 7 strings, compared to TextBuilder. Also, with more strings concatenated, the difference between StringBuilder and TextBuilder gets larger. In code, there are many cases, where there are concatenated
 * 50+ strings so the time saving is even greater.<br>
