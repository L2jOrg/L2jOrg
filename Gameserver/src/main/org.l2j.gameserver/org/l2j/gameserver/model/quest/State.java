/**
 * This class merely enumerates the three necessary states for all quests:<br>
 * <ul>
 * <li>CREATED: a quest state is created but the quest is not yet accepted.</li>
 * <li>STARTED: the player has accepted the quest. Quest is currently in progress</li>
 * <li>COMPLETED: the quest has been completed.</li>
 * </ul>
 * In addition, this class defines two functions for lookup and inverse lookup of the state given a name.<br>
 * This is useful only for saving the state values into the database with a more readable form and then being able to read the string back and remap them to their correct states.<br>
 * All quests have these and only these states.
