/**
 * <p>
 * Abstract base representation of a cron4j task.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Developers can extends this abstract class to build their own tasks.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Extending Task means, above all, implementing the {@link Task#execute(TaskExecutionContext)} method. Within this method the task must perform its operation. If the <em>execute()</em> method returns regularly then the execution is considered to be successfully completed. If <em>execute()</em> dies
 * throwing a {@link RuntimeException} then the task execution is considered to be failed. The supplied parameter, which is a {@link TaskExecutionContext} instance, helps the developer in integrating his task with the scheduler executor. Through the context the developer can check if the execution
 * has been paused or stopped, and he can also push back some status informations by calling {@link TaskExecutionContext#setCompleteness(double)} and {@link TaskExecutionContext#setStatusMessage(String)}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If the custom task supports pausing, stopping and/or tracking, that should be notified by overriding {@link Task#canBePaused()}, {@link Task#canBeStopped()}, {@link Task#supportsCompletenessTracking()} and/or {@link Task#supportsStatusTracking()}.
 * </p>
