Skills are divided into active skill and passive skills. <font color="LEVEL">Active skills,</font> including spells, must be intentionally used. <font color="LEVEL">Passive skills,</font> on the other hand, permanently increase your basic abilities.<br>
First, learn active offensive skills. It will be good to learn a skill that restores your HP while damaging your enemies. There's a <font color="LEVEL">Toggle Skill</font> that you can use to turn the effect on and off. You will be consuming MP when it's on, so make sure you only use it when you need to.<br>
