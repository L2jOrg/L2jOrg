You should have been given two weapons -- a Dagger and a Squire's Sword. Perhaps you have already noticed that daggers and swords perform differently in battle. The <font color="LEVEL">Dagger</font> is swift, but its accuracy suffers, while the <font color="LEVEL">Squire's Sword</font> is noticeably slower than the dagger, but strikes with greater accuracy. Remember that different weapons may call upon different skills in their use. Either is a worthy weapon; it is up to you to decide which suits you best. When you have saved around 500 adena, buy a <font color="LEVEL">Bone Dagger</font> if that's what you prefer, or a <font color="LEVEL">Short Sword</font> if swords are more to your taste.<br>
You may be able to improve your armor from the spoils of the monsters you slay, but that is a matter of luck. If you reach level 5 and are still lacking gloves, shoes or a helmet, you should consider purchasing the cheapest ones offered by the store.<br>
