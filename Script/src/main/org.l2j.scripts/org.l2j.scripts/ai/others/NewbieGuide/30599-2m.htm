First, consider your goal. The Kingdom of Aden is currently is chaos. What better time will there be to restore the Elven people to their ancient greatness?<br>
For now, the most important thing is to simply to get experience with your arts in combat. What could be a greater priority in this time of these?<br>
Begin your training by hunting <font color="LEVEL">Red Keltirs</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Wolves</font> near the village. Be cautious, particularly with the wolves, for they are very savage. When you find an item after slaying a monster, try to equip it, to see if it's better than what you have now. For the rest, if you have no other use for it, sell it at the stores, so you will have Adena when you need it.<br>
