To be a Shillien Knight, your level must be over 40 and you need to collect the Mark of Duty, the Mark of Fate and the Mark of Witchcraft.<br>
You did collect all of the marks, but your level is not high enough. Come back to me after more training. Then I will change your occupation to a Shilien Knight.
