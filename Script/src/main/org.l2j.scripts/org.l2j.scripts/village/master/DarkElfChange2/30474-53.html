Congratulations! You have become an Phantom Summoner of the proud Dark Elves at last. The life of a Phantom Summoner may still feel strange, but you do not need to worry. Everything is going to be all right once you start learning from the Masters around you.<br>
From now on do your best to become a dignified Shilien Oracle that increases the pride of the Dark Elves. I hope you will make the name of Shilen widely known in the world and cause everyone to tremble in fear.
