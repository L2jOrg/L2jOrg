To be a Shillien Elder, your level must be over 40 and you need to collect the Mark of the Pilgrim, the Mark of Fate, and the Mark of the Reformer.<br>
You did collect all of the marks, but your level is not high enough. Come back to me after more training. Then I will change your occupation to a Shillien Elder.
