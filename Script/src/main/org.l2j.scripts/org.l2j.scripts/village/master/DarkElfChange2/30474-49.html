Congratulations! You have become a Spellhowler of the proud Dark Elves at last. The life of a Spellhowler may feel strange now, but you do not need to worry. Everything is going to be all right once you start learning from the Masters around you.<br>
I hope you become a dignified Spellhowler, who lives up to the name of Shilen. Congratulations again on becoming a Spellhowler with strong magical powers.
