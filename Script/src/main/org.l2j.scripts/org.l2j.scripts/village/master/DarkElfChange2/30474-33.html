Congratulations! You have become a Bladedancer of the proud Dark Elves at last. The life of a Bladedancer may still feel strange, but you do not need to worry. Everything is going to be all right once you start learning from the Masters around you.<br>
I hope you become a dignified Bladedancer, who lives up to the name of Shilen. And try harder to become the best swordsman. Congratulations again on becoming a Bladedancer!
