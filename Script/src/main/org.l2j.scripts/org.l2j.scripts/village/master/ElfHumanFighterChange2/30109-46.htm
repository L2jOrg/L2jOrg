Congratulations! You have now become a Warlord. You can learn your skills from the masters nearby. You may not yet know much about being a Warlord, but by learning it one step at a time it will soon be second nature to you.<br>
Dedicate yourself to becoming a powerful and cunning warrior and you will win much glory.<br>
Our guild has prepared this small gift to assist you in your journey. Take this to <font color="LEVEL">the Grand Master, Grand Magister, Master Trainer or High Priest who permits transfers in any major town</font> and you will be able to exchange it for a usable Shadow Weapon.
