Please help the farmers who lost their way of living recover their land from the orcs. As I told you, kill the turek orcs and bring their necklaces back as proof, and I will give you a reward.<br>
Also, do not discard the ancient relics that the orcs keep with them. Collect them all. You can sell them for quite a high price at the village. Why don't you think of it as a kind of bonus for this task?<br>
