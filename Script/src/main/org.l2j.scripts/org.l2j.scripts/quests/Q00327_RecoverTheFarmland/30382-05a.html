Bear in mind that this is a rumor, I've not seen it myself. I was told that mercenaries have been seen returning from the area near the Orc Barracks with relics from the Elmo-Aden period.<br>
Although they are little more than pottery shards, they fetch a high price. If you are interested you should visit a <font color="LEVEL">relics expert</font>.<br>
