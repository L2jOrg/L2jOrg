The Execution Grounds is located in the east part of the village. It is a haunted place where the never-ending cries of dead souls can be heard. Your mission is to purge that place of the undead that infest it. It is said that those doomed souls are being punished  for their massacre of innocents during the farmers' uprising. Well, whatever the reason, we have a job to do. Still, I have a bad feeling about this.<br>
