Captain Bathis want someone who knows about spiders, more than a veteran.<br1>
It looks like he wants to raise someone to hunt spiders expertly in Gludio.<br1>
How many, you ask? I think 30 should be enough.<br1>
There are many spiders to the west of the island. It is pretty far to walk there.<br1>
If you are going to the hunting ground, I can help you.<br>
