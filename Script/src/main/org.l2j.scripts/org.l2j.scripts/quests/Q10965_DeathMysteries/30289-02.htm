<html><body>High Priest Raymond:<br>
The request back then was actually at the behest of High Priest Maximilian from the Temple of Einhasad in the Town of Giran.<br>
The town is pretty far from here and he wished to ask for your assistance directly, but he was concentrated that you might feel burdened by taking on a request from someone that you hardly know. So he asked me to help mhim instead.<br>
