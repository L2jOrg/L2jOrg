Turning a greenhorn adventurer into a half-decent one has always been an important task.<br>
That is right, adventurers like you who havent completed a class transfer yes. If you are skilled enough to transfer class, then there is no reason to delay it.<br>
I would not force you if you are adamant about not transferring your class, but getting it done will be much more beneficial to you. And its not particularly complex either, just look for the Transfer Class button and press it, and thats it.<br>
Alright, enought about the class transfer here. Why dont you get serious and start prepairing to make a name for youself as an adventurer?<br>
