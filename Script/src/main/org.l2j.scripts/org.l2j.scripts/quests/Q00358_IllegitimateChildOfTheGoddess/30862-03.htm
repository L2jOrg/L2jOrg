<html><body>Grand Master Oltlin:<br>
Her anger towards Gran Kain and Einhasad for a time turned Shilen into a pure and perfect being. That is, she became the literal incarnation of destruction.<br>
As she achieved the purest form of fury, her benevolence and austerity left her completely. Her perfect wrath is the source of those evil creatures.<br>
They are sealed away now, and I don't know what their current condition is, but their very existence proves that she has become a goddess of destruction!<br>
We worshippers of Shilen teach our children that she is our mother, therefore we must calm her wrath.<br>
