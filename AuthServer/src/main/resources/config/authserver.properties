# This is the server configuration file. Here you can set up the connection for your server.
# Usually you have to change the hostname option to
# - 127.0.0.1 (if you want to play alone / testing purpose)
# - LAN IP* (if you want to play from another computer in the network)
# - WAN IP** (if you want to play with friends over internet)
# - Questions? => https://github.com/JoeAlisson/L2jOrg/issues
