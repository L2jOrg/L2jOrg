Try hunting <font color="LEVEL">Elder Keltirs</font>, or <font color="LEVEL">Gray Wolves</font> near the village. Your spells most powerful attacks, so look for monsters you can defeat with a single spell until you reach level 3.<br>
At level 6 or above, go southeast and challenge <font color="LEVEL">Kaboo Orcs.</font> The important rule at these levels, is to <font color="LEVEL">hunt the strongest monster you can defeat with two Wind Strikes.</font> And never forget that Orcs are more dangerous, because if one is in danger, others will often come to join the fight.<br>
