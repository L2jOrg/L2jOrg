Have you heard? Antharas has awakened, and Baium has become even stronger! It is great opportunity for you to demonstrate your abilities to Balthus Knights. Do you have the courage to face <font color="LEVEL">Baium</font>?<br>
Although our main target is Antharas, Baium must be defeated first. Kill him and receive Rash's supplies as a reward. Use them wisely!<br>
I can only teleport characters of <font color="LEVEL">level 70</font> and higher. <font color="LEVEL">I will teleport an alliance consisting of 27-300 members to any village of the leader's choice.</font><br>
