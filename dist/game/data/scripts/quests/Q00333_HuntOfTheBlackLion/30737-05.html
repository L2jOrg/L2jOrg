<html><body>Guildsman Morgan:<br>
I cannot thank you enough for recovering our stolen freight boxes. If our commercial guild was in a better financial situation, we would hire competent mercenaries like you as bodyguards... We would surely be safe then!<br>
Your reward was substantially increased after I spoke to my superiors about the hard work you have been doing for our guild. You have earned it, please take it without refusing.<br>
