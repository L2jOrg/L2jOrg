My friend! I'm afraid I have to ask for your help. I got distracted just for a moment, and Kasha Imps stole Red Gems! What's more, they also turned over the jar of varnish and spoiled some other materials. I beg of you, help. Slay Kasha Imps and get back Red Gems. I'll also need some Hard Lens. The ones that got varnish on them are ruined now. To get them you need to kill the creatures named Evil Eye Seers.<br>
