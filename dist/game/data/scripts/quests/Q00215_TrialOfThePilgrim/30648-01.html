To properly use the power of the gods, you must first understand their nature. That learning process can be most intense... Many of a higher level than yours have tried and failed.  I think it would be too hard for you to endure at this moment. Come back after you have advanced your skills.<br>
(This quest may only be performed by Clerics, Oracles, Shilen Oracles, and Orc Shamans of level 35 or higher)
