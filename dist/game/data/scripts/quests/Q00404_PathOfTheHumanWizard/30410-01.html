Nice to meet you, Human. I am a minstrel who savors the music in nature and loves to sing loudly. I regret that I cannot chat with you long. I am in the middle of listening to the song brought to me by the winds of the Wastelands.<br>
You've come because you have some business with me? What business are you talking about?<br>
