<html><body>Filaur of the Gray Pillar:<br>
I am sorry, but if you come back with empty hands I can't reward you, no matter how hard you tried. As I mentioned before, I will reward you based on the amount of <font color="LEVEL">Chrysolite Ore</font> that you collect after defeating <font color="LEVEL">the Utuku Orcs</font>.<br>
And don't forget ...<font color="LEVEL">If you collect four pieces of a torn Map,</font> you should visit Chichirin in the Maphr Temple. If you ask her for help, she will combine those torn pieces and make a complete Map. I will give you a generous reward once you bring me the completed Maps.<br>
