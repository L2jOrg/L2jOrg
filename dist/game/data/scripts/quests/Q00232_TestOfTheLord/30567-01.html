Tejakar Pa'agrio! Praise the Lord of the Flame! I see by the necklace you are wearing that you are a Sorcerer undergoing the Test of the Lord! I, Tantus, undefeated Chief of the Neruga tribe shall teach you...<br>

Once you have an understanding of the totem of the Warriors of Neruga, I will acknowledge you as a Monarch! Now you must find the materials that compose the Neruga tribal totem!<br>
