Our faith teaches nonviolence, peace and sacrifice. I must confess that I question this when I see the current state of affairs. The world is overrun by evildoers and yet here we sit doing nothing but praying, training, giving remedies and alms...<br>
Sometimes I wish that I could make it a better world, where good people live in peace...<br>
Oh my... I've said too much. Please pay no mind to my mutterings... It is far too easy to be mistaken for a heretic around here...<br>
