You cold deliver the armor instead of me! If you go to the West from Fellmere Lake you will meet <font color="LEVEL">Ol Mahum Hierarch Gudz</font>. Tell him about Turek Orcs plans. If Ol Mahums find out that they were used they will not just sit there, they will attack Orcs to avenge themselves.<br>
