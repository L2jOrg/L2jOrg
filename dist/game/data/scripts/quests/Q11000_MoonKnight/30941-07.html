Our revenge has just started! Turek Orcks are going to pay for cheating us!<br>
And you go to Gludin and tell something to the people over there. Tell them that this time to great! Ol Mahums warriors are merciful and will not take their lives! But one day we shall raze Gludin to the ground, so be prepared!
