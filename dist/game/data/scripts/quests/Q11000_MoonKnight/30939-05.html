I have just received a letter from Damion. He wants me to tell you that all of the goods stolen by Ol Mahums were brought back and shipped to the client. Damion is very gratefull. You did a good job.<br>
But... There is another problem. Our spies tell us that Turek Orcs are going through active preparations to attack Gludin. I have reported this to Sir Klaus Vasper but he has only ordered to keep an eye on them. Sir Klaus thinks there way too few Orcs and they will not attack. Hmm...<br>
