<html><body>Captain Bezique:<br>
I can see that you are a youngster filled with enthusiasm. Unfortunately, you also seem too inexperienced for this mission. I'm a good judge of ability, so don't quarrel.<br>
In any event, I'm only concerned for your safety. The bottom line is that this job is simply too dangerous for you right now. Come back to me after you've completed additional training and I'll see what I can do for you...<br>
