Those thieves are surely part of the Ol Mahum straggler troops. The Ol Mahum foreign troops that Gracia hired years ago during the Gracian War, are still pitching runaway troop campsites beyond the mountain north of the village.<br>
One more thing. There is someone who can help you catch those thieves. There is a woman named <font color="LEVEL">Neti</font> who lives in this village... Actually, she was once a chivalrous robber. She sure kept this kingdom's corrupt aristocracy in fear, heh heh. She's also famous as a treasure hunter who found rare and valuable treasure in many ruins.<br>
You might get a cold reception if you go asking for her help, so take this letter with you. She owes me a debt, so she will surely help you.
