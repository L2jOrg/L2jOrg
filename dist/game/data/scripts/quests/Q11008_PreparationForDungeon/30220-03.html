Warrior's Armor is a great choice.<br>
It's better to be ready for anything. Speaking of readiness... The last time I've bought healing elixirs from Herbiel, he told me about creating some new potion. I think it would help me a lot on my way back to the dungeon. However, Herbiel mentioned that he doesn't have enough ingredients to make this potion. Could you help him with that?<br>
Could you visit <font color="LEVEL">Priest Gerald</font> and find out how to help him><br>
