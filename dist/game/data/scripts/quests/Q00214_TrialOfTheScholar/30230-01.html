Ah, a letter from Dieter! Dieter the crybaby! Of course I remember him! Did you say that he became a teacher at the School of Wizardry? Oh, my! He did better than I expected he would... He used to cry like a baby after being scolded by Cronos the wise, and I always had to cheer him up.<br>
Oh, well, what did you say you came here for?<br>
