These memories bring me such pain...<br>
Well, you'll find out soon enough so I might as well tell you.<br>
I stole the books. Master crossed the line that day. I was enraged when he told me I should consider being a farmer... I stole the books that night to spite him.<br>
I hid the books in a very safe place.<br>
I wanted to get Master into trouble... But it got complicated. Master flew into such a rage that, fearing for my life, I went to retrieve the books but they were gone!<br>
