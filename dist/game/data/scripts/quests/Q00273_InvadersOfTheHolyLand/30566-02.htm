<html><body>Atuba Chief Varkees:<br>
The almighty Flame Lord has ordered me to defeat the <font color="LEVEL">Rakeclaw Imps</font>. Have you ever encountered those disgusting creatures? They are an abomination! Spawned from the blackest magic, their very existence defiles our sacred lands.<br>
But they are too cowardly to face us alone -- there must be someone or something else controlling them. I have pledged to the Flame Lord that I will find out the truth, no matter what!<br>
(Only characters who are level 6 and above may undertake this quest.)
