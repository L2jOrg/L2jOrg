Oh, hello there! Starden sent you to me, eh? He's been taking interest in my potions lately. I wanted to brew a new potion, but I don't have enough ingredients. I need <font color="LEVEL">Dead Spider's Ichor</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Moonstone Beast's Scales</font>. However, I'm a poor warrior, so there's no way I can get them by myself. And I can't brew the potion without them! Will you help me?<br>
