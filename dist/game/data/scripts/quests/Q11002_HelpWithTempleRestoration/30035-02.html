You have had a hard time. But you did a great job! Now we can finish the repairs of the collapsed buildings. I have prepared a gift to thank you. I'm sure you will make good use of it.<br>
Make your choice. I would gladly give you all I have, but I need something to reward other travelers! Please, pick just one item.<br>
