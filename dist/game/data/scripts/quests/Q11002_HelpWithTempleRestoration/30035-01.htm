Oh, so you're from Altran? Thank you for helping us out. There are just a few of us here. And I can say we don't manage.<br>
Not only there are not enough people to repair buildings, but we're also constantly being robbed of construction materials. Take the last time, for example! I just got Wooden Poles and a Wooden Door, and they were stolen on the spot! It emerged that the <font color="LEVEL">Wooden Poles</font> were taken by the Orcs for some fire dance of theirs. So, you got it? They're dancing around some fires, that are burning on my building materials! And this time, the stolen <font color="LEVEL">Wooden Poles</font> were found at <font color="LEVEL">Orc Captains and Lieutenants</font>! Can you please bring them back?<br>
I put down the rest of the tasks in this <font color="LEVEL">Inventory Book</font>. Complete them as well.<br>
