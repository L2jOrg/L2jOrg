<html><body>Sir Klaus Vasper:<br>
y comrade of the sword, you are still not experienced enough to become a Knight. I can see the true passion and belief you hold in your heart, but those are not enough -- only through the forge of battle will you also gain the power to hold fast to those beliefs in the midst of unrighteousness.<br>
Come back when you are a little older and wiser. When you are ready, I will test your worthiness to be a true Knight.<br>
(Only characters level 18 and above may undertake this quest.)
