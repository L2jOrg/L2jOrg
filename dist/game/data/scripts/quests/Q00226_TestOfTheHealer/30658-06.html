Thank you so much. Windy has just returned! She must be inside washing up!<br>
Windy! You little rascal! Do you know how worried I was?! Pull one more stunt like that, and you'll get a spanking you will never forget!<br>
Thank you for finding this child. Making a donation and finding a lost child... We are truly in your debt.<br>
Oh yes, by the way, Windy asked me to give this to you. It looks like a trinket that she picked up while playing in the Wastelands...<br>
