Well done! Now I have all I need to fashion a Magical Powers Ruby.<br>
Here, take it!<br>
Before you leave, though, let me give you a word of advice. Talent will only take you so far in your Mystical studies. There is no substitute for hard work and disciplined study. The high-level Mystics of the Ivory Tower spend every waking moment in research, spurning food, sleep, recreation, love and all other distractions. Follow their example and you will advance far!
