Please gather ten arrowheads used by the Tunath Orc Marksmen and bring them to me. I am not collecting them simply for my private purposes, but plan to donate some to Sedrick's Training Hall for exhibition.<br>
Tunath Orcs are in the Elven Ruins. If you don't know where that is, ask Guard Kenyos for directions.
