Reep sent you to me, right? Excellent! I was just looking for someone who will help me put our Marphr's Temple to rights. Unfortunately, after over the last centuries it has lost its former splendor... I tried to do everything myself, but alas! I couldn't find the necessary materials. Could you help me? I will give you this <font color="LEVEL">Temple Reconstruction Request</font>, it lists everything I need.<br>
