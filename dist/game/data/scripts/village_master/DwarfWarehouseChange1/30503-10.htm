<html><body>Warehouse Chief Rikadio:<br>
Congratulations! You've finally become a proud member of the Iron Gate Guild. You can learn the skills you'll need from the Warehouse Keepers over there. Work diligently; remember the old saying that "the most useless thing under the sun is a penniless Dwarf!"<br>
Here is a small gift that our guild has prepared to help you on your journey. Take this to <font color="LEVEL">the Grand Master, Grand Magister, Master Trainer or High Priest who permits transfers in any major town</font> and you will be able to exchange it for a usable Shadow Weapon.
