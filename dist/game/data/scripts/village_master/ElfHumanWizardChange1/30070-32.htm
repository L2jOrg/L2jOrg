Congratulations! You have now become a proud Oracle, a priest of Eva. Many more trials and hardships await you, but I trust that you will overcome them all. May Einhasad and Eva bless and keep you always.<br>
This is a small gift that we have prepared to help you on your journey. Take this to <font color="LEVEL">the Grand Master, Grand Magister, Master Trainer or High Priest who permits transfers in any major town</font> and you will be able to exchange it for a usable Shadow Weapon.
