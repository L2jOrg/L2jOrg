Lend an ear, young Orc, and I will tell you of the origin of our race. The great god Pa'agrio simmoned forth flame as white-hot as the sun, and from it he brought forth the father of the Orcs. His hair blazed red, his eyes shone white, smoke prured from his nostrils with every breath, and blood hotter than lava boiled through his veins!<br>
He was mightier than any other living being, but when he came down from the heavens, the water cooled his body, the earth hardened his lava blood, and the air dispersed his smoke. Our father mourned the loss of his great strength and asked Pa'agrio to slay him -- death was better than weakness. But the god told him that through constant, unrelenting discipline and combat, he could regain his former might. That is why we, his descendants, are as merciless toward ourselves as we are towards our enemies. Only through harship will we reach true strength!<br>
