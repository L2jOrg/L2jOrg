<html><body>Information Broker Roo-roo:<br>
If you believe that we, Information Brokers, are mere merchants.... Oh, huh. Fine, I must clarify one thing!<br>
An Information Broker who lost customers' trust is just like a warrior left unarmed on a battlefield. The primary area of focus for an Information Broker is his or her authority, not money. We make money thanks to our authority.<br>
