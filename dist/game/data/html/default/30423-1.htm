It is a story two lovers, in a time long ago. One day the man discovered that he was infected with an incurable disease. Even magic was useless against it. Rather than tell his lover, he feigned anger and forced her away.<br>
Within a year both were dead, he of the illness and she of a broken heart. Fate can be quite merciless, don't you think?<br>
