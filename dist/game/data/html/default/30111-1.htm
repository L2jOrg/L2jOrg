And after I just warned you about the dangerous curiosity... Tut tut!<br>
Well, best you hear it from me, I suppose, rather than discover it for youself. You have heard of the wizard named Hardin, have you not? He is Necromancer who studies the Dark Magic prohibited by the commandments of the Ivory Tower.<br>
It corrupts its users and leads to destruction... It must be avoided like a contagion. Sadly, many capable wizards have allowed themselves to be persuaded by Hardin's parior tricks and become his pupils. We are not safe from his influence, even here. Always be on guard!<br>
