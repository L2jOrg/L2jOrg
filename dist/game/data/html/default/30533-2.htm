Our guild specializes in trade between the different races. We are experts in trade and diplomacy. While other races go to war for hornor and political again, our guild sees profit as a path power. Our guild does not trade trivial daily necessities! We only deal with gold, silver, jewelry, accessories, and precious magic items.<br>
Our customers are the aristocracy and powerful families from many kingdoms. Doing business with them is not only for profit, we alos keep watch on their affairs. We never know when some greedy outside will get a notion no invade and try to take our proerty. To prevent this, we keep watch, and raise money to trian armies or hire soldiers, if necessary, to protect our wealth and peace.<br>
