<html><body>Astrologer Creta:<br>
Welcome, stranger... My name is Creta and I earn my living by fortune telling.<br>
In the past, even the Lords of the land came to us for their fortunes... But people often fear what they cannot understand and fortune telling has had an unfavoraable light shone upon it by those whack-job religious types. I can no longer practice my skills in the open, only in small, insignificant places, like here.<br>
