No one understands injustice better than I do. I know the rage you feel. I know from personal experience.... that consuming need for vengeance.<br>
Evil cannot be left unpunished! Revenge is not only desirable, it is nessary, and eradicate evil, those who commit evil acts must themselves be eliminated.<br>
Listen to your rage! Replease it to become an instrument of justice!<br>
