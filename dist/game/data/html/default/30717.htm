I am sorrowed to see such discord here in this Tower. If we all persue the same truth, how can we so easily turn on each other? The Grand Masters have long prophesied a coming wave of chaos that threatens to engulf us all. I suspect it can only be overcome if our races let go of old grudges and learn to trust each other.<br>
One hopful sign in the news that Elves and Humans are working together to clean up the Sea of Spores. Perhaps that will provide the foundation upon which we can build a lasting peace....<br>
