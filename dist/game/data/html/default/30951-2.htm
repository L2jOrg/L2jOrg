It's a device developed by the ancients to move quickly within the tower. You can move instantly to another level of this tower using this, but, you need a Dimensional Stone in order to activate the machine. If you wish to go to the <font color="LEVEL">Middle Level</font>, you'll need a <font color="LEVEL">Blue Dimensional Stone</font>. If you wish to go to the <font color="LEVEL">Upper Level</font>, you'll need a corresponding <font color="LEVEL">Green Dimensional Stone</font>.<br>
The problem is that it's really difficult to get them, especially the Red Dimensional Stone - Platinum Tribes and angels have them. Maybe the steps would be a better option for you?<br>
