<html><body>Atuba Chief Varkees:<br>
Tejakar Oroka! There are as many Orc tribes as there are stars in the night sky! However, noble blood flows through the veins of only 7 tribes. Listen well as I tell you their names!<br>
The brave Hestui!<br>
The merciless Atuba!<br>
The unrelenting Neruga!<br>
The strong-willed Urutu! The resourceful Duda-Mara!<br>
And the ferocious Gandi!<br>
There are also tribes of traitors whose names have been arased from our annals -- may they be forever disgraced!<br>
