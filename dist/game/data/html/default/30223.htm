In the quest for money or power or fame, it's easy to lose sight of the truly important things in life. Once I spent every waking moment studing magic, hoping to unravel the mysteries of the cosmos.<br>
But now I hear the birds chirping and feel the sun on my face and think about <font color="LEVEL">the woman I love.</font> And I realize that these innocent joys are actually the most important treasure the universe can offer.<br>
What about you? Do you have something you cherish too?<br>
