<font color="LEVEL">Ashen Wolf</font>.<br>
These predators haunt village outskirts. They have been attacking young Orcs often lately. There's got to be too many of them. Slay them in memory of our killed brothers...<br><br>
<font color="LEVEL">Goblin Tomb Raider</font>.<br>
These cursed Goblins raid tombs of our ancestors. Teach them a harsh lesson.<br><br>
<font color="LEVEL">Rakelaw Imp Hunter</font>.<br>
They tail after Goblin Tomb Raiders and commit their atrocities together. They need to be punished too.<br><br>
<font color="LEVEL">Mountain Fungus</font>.<br>
We don't have enough ingredients to make the drinks for the Flame Festival. The more Fungus you bring, the better.<br><br>
<font color="LEVEL">Maraku Werewolf</font>.<br>
They have been sighted near village again. Drive them away before they make some kind of trouble.<br><br>
<font color="LEVEL">Eye of Seer</font>.<br>
If you put some Eye of Seer Tears onto a wound, it'll heal fast. Such a thing should be carried by every warrior.
