<html><body>Required Materials:<br>
(Document that lists materials needed for making a new sword. Seems unlikely that it was written by Sumari.)<br
Greetings, my brothers. To make a training blade you're going to need these:<br>
1. Hilt: coil <font color="LEVEL">Blackwing Bat Wing</font> around it so it'll be nice to grip. This is a great material.<br>
2. Sword belt: just take <font color="LEVEL">Grave Robber's Belt</font>. A sword should be held in your hand, not dangle on your belt.<br>
3. Blade: The stock of <font color="LEVEL">Golem Ore</font> is almost empty. Sumari asks for a new supply of it. Bring him as much as he needs.<br>
4. Sheath: can be made from a <font color="LEVEL">Hide of an Evil Eye Patrol</font>. Prepare a lot of hides, so we won't run out for sure.<br>
And lastly: find someone to teach <font color="LEVEL">Sumari</font> how to read already. I'm sick of repeating the same things for him over and over again.<br>
