<font color="LEVEL">Bleeding Suppression Medicine</font><br>
Scavenger Spiders recover their strength really fast even if you tear off their limb or stick a dagger into their belly. Looks like the reason for this is because <font color="LEVEL">Dead Spider's Ichor</font> hardens instantlyupon contact with air. It's precisely because of this feature that it couldn't be used for healing before. But, as we found out recently, that Ichor remains liquid if you put <font color="LEVEL">Moonstone Beast's Scales</font> into it. And, armed with such knowledge, from now on we will be able to create a medicine with instant healing effect.
