<html><body>New Cleaning Tool's Supply List<br>
After that incident with Marphr's statue Priest Daichir charged me with cleaning it and gave me one Month to do it. Here is the list of materials that I need for that:<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Bat Bristle</font><br>
Bristles from the neck of a <font color="LEVEL">Barbed Bat</font>. Because of it softness It's used for adorning clothes. It will make a perfect dustbrush, since it won't leave any traces on Marphr's statue.<br><br>
<font color="LEVEL">Trimden Web</font><br>
Web threads of <font color="LEVEL">Trimdens</font> are very sticky, which is going to help me with my work. You can shove it into hard-to-reach spots and gather all dust with it.<br><br>
<font color="LEVEL">Kerope Werewolf's Twig Charm</font>
<font color="LEVEL">Kerope Werewolves</font> use such kind of charms. As the rumor goes, if you told it to cracks or scratches, they will disappear.<br>
