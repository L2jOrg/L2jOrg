This is a list of tasks that need to be completed before starting that hunt of Talos. Everything must go without a hitch. take care of it.<br><br>
<font color="LEVEL">Gathering of Wolf Tails</font>.<br>
Collect Tails to mark Monsters that need to be hunted. You need to procure at least 1000 of Ashen Wolf Tails. Each participant has to bring at least 10 of them.<br><br>
<font color="LEVEL">Defeating Goblins</font>.<br>
Goblins somehow found out about the location of the hunt and came running from all over the region. Take their poisonous darts from them, or they are going to spoil our hunt.<br><br>
<font color="LEVEL">Defeating Imps</font>.<br>
Dumb Imps scared away all game. Make sure that they won't appear here when it's time for the hunt.<br><br>
