I'm sure you know, but there's a fearsome dragon in the north named Antharas that makes its home there. He hasn't been sighted lately, but the region where he lives is called the Dragon Valley. Only the most fearsome monsters are gathered in those parts. They say that someone met a drake there last week, and barely escaped with his life. Scary isn't it?<br>
