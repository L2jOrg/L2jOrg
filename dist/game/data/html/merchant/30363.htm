<html><body>Blacksmith Aios:<br>
May the splendor of mithril shine trough the forest and lake forever. I repair weapons and armor for my Elven brothers. I returned here not long ago from the far northen Dwarven Kingdom, where I learned how to process Adamantite and Oriharukon from master Dwarven craftsmen.<br>
I have hardly been home and already have more work than I can handle. What can I do for you?<br>
