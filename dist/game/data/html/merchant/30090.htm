Welcome, traveler. There is so much to see in this world. I heard these are sword that spit fire and magic shoes that let you fly... Do you think those things really exist? Have you ever seen them? I know we have weird stuff, but I can't believe those things really exist. Ah, sorry. How can I help you?<br>
