When I was young I studied at the Einhovant School of Wizardry. In the end, I realized that I had no talent in magic and quit, but thanks to the schooling I was able to acquire knowledge in various fields. I gave up studying and became a trader, but the knowledge I learned at magic school greatly assists me in my business.<br>
