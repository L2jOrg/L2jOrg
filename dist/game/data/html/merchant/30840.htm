Hm, Lately there have been rumor about a limited opening of a border with Elmore, but it's not clear whether it's misheard talks from bigwigs or they're going to tighten the crews even more instead.....<br>
You see, my brother moved to Elmore hoping to start a trading business there..... And I'm worried that I won't be able to see him again even once.<br>
