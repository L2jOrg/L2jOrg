I'm sure tou know that you've come to a special place. I'm very skilled artisan. Here you can order dualsword weapons and get a weapon of a higher grade. Hehe....<br>
But know this, only a few can make Dualsword weapons. Something else... Since this weapon is one of the deadiest ones its production is limited.<br>
So you have to get a Dual Weapon Crafting Stamp first.<br>
When you get this document bring it to me along with the swords you want to use for a Dualsword weapon. And I'm going to make a great weapon for you!<br>
Ah! By the way, you should know that it's impossible to fuse weapons with unique properties.<br>
Also, keep in mind that any weapon modifications will be lost in the fusion process.<br>
Now select the fitting swords<br>
