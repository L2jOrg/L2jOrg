How are the Dark Elves doing? I'm worried about them. Those Dark Elves have been battling Shilen's evil creatures.... and now, we can't even get near the village to check on them. It's too dangerous. Yes, during times like this, ample food storage becomes very important. You never know when our town might be surrounded by evil, slobbering red-yeyed creatures from the deep dark swamps... errr... Sorry. If you're out of room in you packs, you can leave your items with me. My warehouse is well secured against unvaders, fire, magical attack and mold.<br>
