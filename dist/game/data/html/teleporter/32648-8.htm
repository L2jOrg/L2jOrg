Recommended for adventurers who are <font color="LEVEL">level 80 or higher</font>, the big news from the Giant's Cave is the appearance of <font color="LEVEL">Hekaton Prime</font>.<br>
Core and Hekaton Prime used to protect the area, and now they have again regained their strength. Ancient bio weapons developed by the Giants have been used to eliminate the monsters in the vicinity. The remaining 3 Giant Guardians now protect Hekaton Prime.<br>
Finally, Expedition Leader Sobling has finally completed building a teleportation gate that allows entry to the Giant's Cave. If you want to explore the area, go see him.<br>
