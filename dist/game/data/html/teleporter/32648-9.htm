<html><body>Update Announcer:<br>
Recommended for adventurers who are <font color="LEVEL">level 81 or higher</font>, it is reported in the Den of Evil that Shaman Varangka has finally succeeded in summoning the evil Fiend Kasha!<br>
Since then, the monsters there have grown very strong. Even worse, Kasha's Eyes have magically enslaved many Ragna Orcs!<br>
If you go to the Den of Evil, be sure to take some trusted friends with you.<br>
