Hey there, I see you aroung quite often these days. Me? Can't you tell just by looking? I'm the guardian of this village, Defender Rumant of course! Ah, standing here all day hurts my back. Has the time come for me to hang up my boots already? Sign, I wonder if I will ever be as famous as <font color="LEVEL">Hero Lucien</font> and live a life of luxury and comfort....<br>
