If you follow this road northeast, you will to the Ruins of Agony. Originally, it was the village of Bernice, where I was born, but it was reduced to ashes by the war. If you see its ghastly state, you will understand why it's now called the <font color="LEVEL">Ruins of Agony.</font><br>
If you pass the ruins and continue north, you will arrive at the <font color="LEVEL">forest where the Dark Elves live.</font> Althrough I've never gone there myself.... Travelers say that it is dark and eerie in a very unnatural way.<br>
