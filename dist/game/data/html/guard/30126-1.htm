There are a lot of talks about Grand Wizard Hardin, but few know about his true nature. Some say he was sent by Beleth, some believe that he has cursed the Dark Elves, others say that he helped King raoul to unite the Kingdom of Aden.I don't know that's true and what's not, but one thing I know for sure. There's no Wizard, more powerful than Hardin.<br>
