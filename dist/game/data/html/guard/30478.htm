If you go to the east,there is a large lake. That is Lake Innadril. The problem is, what you see is only a small part of the lake. Actually the entire lake is much larger. Furthermore, the blue dragon Fafurion lives on one of the islands on the lake. The lake is beautiful, but it could actually be the most dangerous place in these parts.<br>
