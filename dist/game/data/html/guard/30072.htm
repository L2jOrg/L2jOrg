Ahh.... Leave me alone. Can't you see me hard at work? I have no time to chat with a country bumpkin like you. Stop bothering me and get the hell out of my sight, thank you.<br>
Hey you, country bumpkin! There's a little village where you'll fit right in. It's called <font color="LEVEL">Floran</font> village and you can get there by following the trail in front of where I stand. It's a perfect little country village for a country bumpkin like you.<br>
