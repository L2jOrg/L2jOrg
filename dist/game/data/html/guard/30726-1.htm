The thing is, these craters aroung the Ivory Tower were made by shooting stars a long time ago. The Ivory Tower was created by Mystics who knew the mysterious power of exinguished stars.<br>
The Elmoreden Empire was governed by Mystics who harnessed the power of these stars, but as time passed the power ebbed and the influence of the Ivory Tower grew weaker.
