Talking Island may look peaceful at first glance, but if you go outside of the village, it is a very dangerous place. There are beasts like wolves and giant spiders, and savage tribes like the Orcs and werewolves. Therefore, if you wander around the island carelessly, you may lose your life.<br>
In particular, Orcs travel around in groups so you must be extra careful of their approach. Recently, there have been rumors that they are frequently around the <font color="LEVEL">Obelisk of Victor.</font> Be careful<br>
