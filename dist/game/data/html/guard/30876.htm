Hello, traveler! Welcome to Aden Village.<br>
If you are interested in seeing the sights of Aden, you should visit the Cemetery. It is the final resting place of the royalty and holy ones since the time of Elmoreden. Of course, the unifying king His Royal Highness Raoul and the previous kings are all sleeping there. To get there just follow the raod to the east. I recommend toy go and take a look sometime.<br>
Recently the cemetery has been neglected.... Those troublesome magpies.<br>
