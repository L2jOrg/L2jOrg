Have you been to Lake Narcel, south of the village? Once you could rent a boat at the pier or fish from the lakeside..... It was quite charming. During the war all the recreational facilities on the lake were closed. His Royal Highness Amadeo has been seen recently riding in a boat with Sir Castella.... Could this signal the rebirth of our precious lake? That would be marvelous!<br>
