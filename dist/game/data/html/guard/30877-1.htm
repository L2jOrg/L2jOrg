Is that so? Well then, hold on. First I must inventory your belongings and appearance. What is your name?<br>
......?<br>
.... What kind of a name is that? Alright, whatever. If you insist on going to the Shilen Holy Place, then there some things I must tell you.<br>
You probably know that this place is where the depraved god Shilen gave birth to six dragons and then transformed them into death goddesses. According to legend, the army of light defeated the corrupt god but was unable to kill the goddesses and so they sealed them in that place. There are therefore many religious researchers, clergymen and fanatics gathered there....<br>
Some are very strange. They want to kill not just the Dark Elves that serve Shieln but also servants of the god of light, as well as other gods.<br>
Needless to say, this is a dangerous political environment. The watchers send by the religious bodies to stop this blasphemy have thrown their hands up in disgust. Therefore, I beg you if you go there please avoid doing anything which could be misinterpreted.<br>
