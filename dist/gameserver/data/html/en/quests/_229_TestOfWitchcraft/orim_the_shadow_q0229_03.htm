Orim of the Shadow:<br>
The power of darkness itself is neither good nor bad. Just as nobody judges a sharp blade if it is good or bad... The magic depends wholly on the user. It may be used for justice as much as it may be used for slaughter and destruction.<br>
The Wizards of the Ivory Tower and the Priests of Einhasad threaten us by saying that the studying or using of any Black magic is extremely dangerous. It's just another branch of magic, but they blame it as a filthy and immoral action. Those who never understand the truth that exists on the other side as well, are detesting.<br>
I don't know where you have been taught like that but if you have such kind of prejudice, you'd better give it up. But, if you are ready to learn Black magic despite the bullying and scorn of people around you, I will gladly accept you as company.<br>
