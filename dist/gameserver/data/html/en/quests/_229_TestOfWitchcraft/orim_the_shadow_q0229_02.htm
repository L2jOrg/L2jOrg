Orim of the Shadow:<br>
The power of darkness itself is neither good nor bad. Just as nobody judges a sharp blade if it is good or bad... The magic depends wholly on the user. It may be used for justice as much as it may be used for slaughter and destruction. But there is no denying on the fact that it IS a powerful tool. Therefore, to learn Black magic it requires a certain degree of spiritual cultivation. In your eyes however, I can read the greediness to acquire forbidden power. But just as no parent would give a child a sword in their hands, I cannot hand down the Black magic to you.<br>
(Quest available only for Wizards, Knights, Palus Knights above level 39.)
