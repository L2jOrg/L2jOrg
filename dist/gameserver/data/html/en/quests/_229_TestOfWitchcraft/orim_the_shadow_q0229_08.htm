Orim of the Shadow:<br>
This box is sealed so tightly that it is impossible to open it by force. On each side of the box there is a hole where you can stick in a jewel, and the hole is some kind of lock. The box will open itself only when you fit in all 6 jewels in the right order. So opening the box itself is a riddle.<br>
You can find out what the jewels look like if you look at this illustrated book. <font color="LEVEL">Your task will be to find out the 6 jewels.</font> In the meantime, I shall study the orders to put in the jewels.<br>
I heard that there were a few jewels crafted in the empirical style that were put up for auction in the <font color="LEVEL">Luxury Gallery of Giran Castle Town</font>. You'd better go and check those first.
