Trader Nestle:<br>
You mean the <font color="LEVEL">Jewel of Aklantoth</font>. I asked Trader Alexandria of Giran to sell it at auction. There are 6 jewels altogether in one set, but unfortunately we have only acquired 3 of them so far. What a pity! I would have been able to sell them in an even higher price if I had the whole collection...<br>
