Orim of the Shadow:<br>
Then take a look at this. It is something that I found in the Cruma Tower one day. A cube made out of a mysterious substance. They say that the Wizards of the ancient kingdom called it a 'spirit container' because it could hold a dead person's spirit in it. That is how they tried to keep all the great scholars and philosophers' knowledge and experience.<br>
This box right here contains the spirit of Magus Aklantoth in the days of Elmoreden. Recently, he woke up from his 1,000-year sleep. It is faint, but clear enough... I hear his voice, calling me... He has promised to teach me all he knows in magic if I free his spirit from the box. You can always rely on a Wizard's word... So, what we need to do is open this box, and we'll have access to the secrets of black magic from the age of the empire.<br>
