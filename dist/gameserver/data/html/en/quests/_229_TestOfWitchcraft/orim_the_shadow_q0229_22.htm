Orim of the Shadow:<br>
The <font color="LEVEL">necklace of Master Iker</font>? How obstinate of her, indeed! I shall get rid of this necklace right away. The Wizards of the Ivory Tower have been watching us all along with this necklace.<br>
Thank you very much, anyway. And sorry, also. Because of my arrogance and carelessness there could have been a great disaster. Thanks to you, we could barely escape the situation. I am the one to blame. I couldn't read the demon's tricks and I was blinded by the greediness for knowledge... I can't blame the devil itself either. He was just true to his dark instincts of provoking death and destruction. After all, the Wizard who couldn't control that power, is to blame...<br>
I wish I could let you meet with Hardin right away, but I am too ashamed to see his face. To restore my dignity, I shall concentrate on my meditation for a while. Now, I shall give you the <font color="LEVEL">Mark of Witchcraft</font>. From now on, the road of the Magus will open in front of thee.
