Orim of the Shadow:<br>
Sword of Binding! And the Soul-trap Crystal! You acquired the 2 holy objects! Now, if only we find out where Zeruel is...!<br>
My searching spell wasn't exactly a success, so I couldn't find out Zeruel's location exactly, but I have a clue of where he might be. I think he is now in the northern part of Dion Castle Town, <font color="LEVEL">somewhere near the Floran Village</font>. It is likely that he is <font color="LEVEL">dwelling inside a human body</font>. <br>
When Zeruel reveals himself, fight him and kill his body with all your might. <font color="LEVEL">But, remember. The last stroke must be done with Sword of Binding</font>. Then you must seal his spirit with the Soul-trap Crystal. You can do it. Please hurry.
