High Priest Sylvain:<br>
I shall give you a task on the purification of light.<br>
As you know it is my duty to purify the unclean energy in this land. The eastern execution ground of this village is the place where numerous people from the peasant's uprising were killed. It is the place which draws a dark shadow all over Dion. Perhaps because of such history, there are so many creatures being born to that place. <br>
Your task is to comfort the irritated spirits of the execution ground, and cooperate in the purifying of this land. It is not a simple nor easy matter that can be solved in a short time. It requires patience and constant efforts. Will you join me in the <font color="LEVEL">purifying job of the Execution Ground</font>?<br>
