Trader Edroc:<br>
letter... The letter! Oh, yes, yes... It must be some 20 years ago, but I do remember. There was a big fuss about a stolen book, and the burglar... Hmm?<br>
Yes, he sure seemed strange to me as well. Back then, the atmosphere wasn't so friendly among the Dwarves, Dark Elves and Humans.<br>
What? The far west...? Uh? What fortune-teller?...<br>
Ah, yes, I remember now. I was sitting inside the apple container that night, and right beside me, they were talking about going to Gludin Harbor, or whatever. Perhaps they stole the expensive book and hid it there?  They were in such a hurry that they didn't even notice that something else came along with the inn fee.<br>
Wait a moment please! Where... did I put it...? Yeah. It was an envelope which had nothing in it. I kept it just in case...  It says here <font color="LEVEL">Raut the Warehouse Keeper</font>. Do you want to have it?
