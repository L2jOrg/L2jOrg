Grand Sorcerer Jurek:<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Beamer Skin, Shaman Necklace, Shackle Scalp</font>. You have brought me all that I have asked of you. I thank you on behalf of the Magician's Guild of Giran. With this, I will be able to find evidence to support my suspicions. If possible, I would also like to find out Hardin's true purpose.<br>
As a token of my appreciation, I will give you my mark. I believe you are more than qualified to accept this. Now return to <font color="LEVEL">Mirien</font>.
