Sage Cronos<br>
You clumsy man. You should find that out for yourself! If you have completely no idea, I will give you a clue. Go and meet this guy called  <font color="LEVEL">Dieter</font> from the <font color="LEVEL">Sorcerers' Guild in Giran</font>. He used to be one of my servants... Anyway, I suppose you'll be able to get some advice from him. Don't lose time! Take this mark and letter in case he refuses to meet a greenhorn like you !
