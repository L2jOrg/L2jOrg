Magister Mirien:<br>
Good. From now on, you will have to seek the highly appreciated Scholar Magicians and complete the tasks that they give you. If you complete all the tasks, you will be qualified for the trial.<br>
The person that you'll have to meet first is <font color="LEVEL">High Priest Sylvain</font>. He is the one who has studied more than anyone about the light's purifying power. He is also in charge of the spiritual purification of Dion territory. In the past, he also participated in the Sea of Spores' purifying plan by the Elves.<br>
Go and meet the High Priest with this mark. The High Priest will give you the appropriate task. Come back to me after completing the task.
