Marya:<br>
No clues? I need to have my scrolls back to help you...<br>
Speaking about Lucas telling about the fortune teller, it reminds me of something. I know an astrologer who has been a long-time friend with our family. I think I'd better ask him for some help.<br>
He is <font color="LEVEL">Creta the Astrologer</font> and I've never seen him since the uprising of the peasants... He is now living in <font color="LEVEL">Floran Village</font>.<br>
Go and meet the man with the letter that I write for you. Please.
