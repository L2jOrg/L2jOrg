Magister Mirien:<br>
Good job. I heard that High Priest Sylvain asked you to bring back the Crystal of Purity? I am glad to see that my worries were vain. Congratulations!<br>
The next person that you have to see is<font color="LEVEL">Grand Sorcerer Jurek</font>. He stays in the <font color="LEVEL"> Wizard Guild of Giran Castle Town</font>. He was an influential man who even used to be Chief Wizard of the Ivory Tower, but he got sick and tired of the fight between factions within the Ivory Tower and quit.<br>
Now, take this mark and set off to see <font color="LEVEL">Jurek</font> in Giran Castle Town. I wish you a safe journey.
