Marya:<br>
The excursion grounds...? I know... Many people were killed unjustly there. Among them were my families and relatives...<br>
OK. I will do my part if it helps in comforting the depressed souls.<br>
However... Somebody stole the scroll where I wrote down the secret methods for making the purifying crystal. It has already been a month, since. I reported this incident to the guard but for the moment, the crystal's whereabouts seems obscure. Take the letter that I write for you and ask <font color="LEVEL">Captain Lucas</font> about the progress in the investigation.
