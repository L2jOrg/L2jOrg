Veteran Ascalon:<br>
You have returned! How was Mason? Please tell me in detail. <br>
...You say with your mouth that he is living happily, but the expression on your face says something else. Tell me the truth!<br>
...What! Never did I imagine that he would be living a lonely, wretched life after losing all his family during the assault of Grecia... Perhaps his agony would be much lessened by now, since you have completed his revenge.<br>
A Warrior must share the pains with his fellow, but still we cannot stop fighting. It is time for you to fight once more.<br>
