Mason:<br>
Up until this day, I wished I could tear the remaining soldiers in Grecia's army in this territory to death. But I am afraid that I grew too weak to revenge them myself.<br>
I will give you this ring that I wore in my army days. Please wear it and seek my revenge. Kill them all, kill the <font color="LEVEL">Bloody Axe</font> who took away the lives of my dear family. Those Ol Mahums are staying in the <font color="LEVEL">northern part of Oren</font>. You will be able to find their army post when you move farther north from the Corridor of Death of Kiran.<br>
It won't be enough until you have at least cut down<font color="LEVEL">100 heads</font> of Bloody Axe!
