Veteran Ascalon:<br>
Oops! Aren't  you an Orc? You look strong, sure thing. Are you a Warrior by any chance? Or perhaps a hired soldier? You remind me of my younger days when I used to work as a hired soldier... When I was young I used to be hired as a soldier. Back in those days I wandered around freely and fought against the alien army and made love with foreign women. There were times when things seemed to be too harsh, but even then, my blazing spirits as a Warrior never burned low. The flaming friendship among comrades, struggles, fierce battles, love and romance, I experienced them all. We were true Warriors.<br>
But I am too old now. If I find a talented young fellow who will succeed me, I would like to retire in peace. I can see that you are quite a well-trained Warrior, what do you say? Will you try to the <font color="LEVEL">Test of the Champion</font>?<br>
