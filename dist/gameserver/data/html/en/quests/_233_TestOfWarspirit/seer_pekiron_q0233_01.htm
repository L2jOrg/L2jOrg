Seer Pekiron:<br>
I heard the story from Seer Somak! So, you are looking for the bones of Tonar? Then, first I must tell you about superman Tonar, our great hero!<br>
As you may know, Tonar lead the crack contingent of Hetsui and drove out all the Leto lizardmen from Oren. But as a last resort, the lizardmen shaman called out the flame worm. One by one, the warriors of Hetsui fell down to the ground by the flames shot out from the worm's mouth. Just then, Tonar, unarmed, leapt on the worm and broke off its neck! But Tonar himself was severely burnt and died soon after!<br>
