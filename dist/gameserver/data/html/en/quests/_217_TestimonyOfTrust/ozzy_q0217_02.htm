Hierarch Asterios:<br>
Trust between the Elves and Humans? That's easy to say, but the truth is that it is not so simple... <br>
Foolish Humans... I don't get the point of you Humans who broke our faith once, and want it back again now. Sorry to say but we don't trust Humans anymore. <font color="LEVEL">If you can represent the Humans and show us how strong-willed you are about regaining our trust, I'll give it a second thought.</font><br>
