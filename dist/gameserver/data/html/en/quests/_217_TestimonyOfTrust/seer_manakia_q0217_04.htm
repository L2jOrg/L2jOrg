Seer Manakia:<br>
It seems like you have done well in the fight with the wild boars... Thank you.  If we look into these <font color="LEVEL">Parasites of Lota</font> we'll be able to figure out the person who dares to control the totem spirits. I can't help this nasty feeling about this case... I can smell something bad. Perhaps this is only the tip of the iceberg to what's about to happen. I wish my guesses were wrong... But I guess that my wishes are only wishes, since the approaching of the <font color="LEVEL">Chaotic Chronicle</font> is there to see. I admit that you were of great help in solving this case. Give this letter to <font color="LEVEL">Paagrio Lord</font>.
