Paagrio Lord Kakai:<br>
Hrrmph! Trust. You Humans always seek to rely on the help of others. Is it a residual effect of your lowly past of slavery? Once a slave, forever a slave, eh? In that case, fine. If you beg for help, I do not plan to refuse you. However, there is a price you must pay.<br>
Do not quiver in fright. It is a simple request. I wouldn't dream of asking any more from a Human.<br>
Recently Seer Manakia of Giran sent a letter asking me to send soldiers to face the evil spirits that appear in those parts. And so, the elite Warriors of the Hestui tribe were sent to Giran. But we have lost contact with them. Go and find out what has happened to them. Take this letter and go to <font color="LEVEL">Seer Manakia</font> of the Town of Giran.
