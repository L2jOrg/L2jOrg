Maestro Nikola:<br>
Hooray! Hello. Anyone willing to help me is most welcome.<br>
They say that there is a mechanical instrument called <font color="LEVEL">Core</font>in a hidden place in Cruma Tower. I think it is a 'mechanic brain' made by the high techniques of the Giants.<br>
The problem is that recently somebody woke up the Core which was asleep for thousands of years. The Core began to control the creatures in this area. It is not certain whether the Core moves according to its own thoughts or someone else is behind the scenes, but what is for sure is that the lives of the nearby habitants are threatened because of the Core. Not to mention that it has a huge harm on the 'Black Anvil' Guild where the Giants study science technology.<br>
