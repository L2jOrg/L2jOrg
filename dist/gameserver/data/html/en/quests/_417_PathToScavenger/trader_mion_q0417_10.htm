Trader Mion:<br>
Humph! And I was trying to get some free work done in the name of my brother!<br>
You are just as lazy as he is! I would be better off if I did it! My brother said he would stop by at the <font color="LEVEL">abandoned mine east of the village</font>, and then go to the <font color="LEVEL">east end of the Dwarven kingdom</font> to praise the work of Lucien. Then, he was going to go see the wide ocean on the <font color="LEVEL">northern coastline</font>.<br>
But if you want to find him, you will go through some difficulties! Hu hu! Well then, good luck!
