Gantaki Zu Urutu:<br>
Tejakar Oroka! You have brought the fiery spirit scroll! Magnificent, young one! With this, you have obtained the first of the two scrolls you must have to become a Paagrio Monk.<br>
To find the second scroll, you must first journey to the Human land of Gludio and meet <font color="LEVEL">Prefect Kasman</font>. He is staying in a village called <font color="LEVEL">Gludin</font>. When you meet him, show him this letter. Then he'll know I sent you and will tell you how to find the scroll.<br>
Now it is time for you to leave. May the flame lead you to victory.
