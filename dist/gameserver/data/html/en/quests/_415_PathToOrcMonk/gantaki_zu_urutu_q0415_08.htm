You haven't obtained the fiery spirit scroll yet? No wonder! Khavatari Rosheek, above all others, regards the tradition of Kabart very dearly! He will not give the scroll to just anyone! Look here, young one!! Grit your teeth and try again! Did you think it would be that easy to earn the qualifications of a Paagrio Monk?!
