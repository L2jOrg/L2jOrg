Atuba Chief Varkees:<br>
The almighty Paagrio Lord has ordered me, Varkees, to defeat the disgusting <font color="LEVEL">rakeclaw imps.</font> Young Orc, have you experience in fighting against rakeclaw imps? They are creatures created from the power of black magic. These blasphemous creatures are defiling our holy land even as we speak!<br>
I do not think that these petty creatures are brave enough to face us Orcs. There must be someone behind them! I will find out the secret powers controlling them, no matter what! <br>
(Quest for characters level 6 and above.)
