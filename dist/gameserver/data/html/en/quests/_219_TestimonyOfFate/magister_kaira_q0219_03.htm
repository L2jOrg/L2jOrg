Magister Kaira:<br>
Our task is to discover the hidden facts, and reveal the truth. The Dark Elves have the shortest history and are the fewest in number among the 5 races, but we understand the power of darkness better than anybody else. We explore and manage without fear the very thing that other tribes fears, the power of darkness, the ultimate secrets veiled under the abyss of darkness.... This is our strength.<br>
That the more we uncover the truth and reveal hidden knowledge, the stronger we will become. This is what we firmly believe. If you can discover the<font color="LEVEL">Forbidden Knowledge</font>and thereby enrich our spiritual heritage, you will be acknowledged for your contribution and be given the qualifications to win a promotion to a higher rank Warrior or Magician.<br>
