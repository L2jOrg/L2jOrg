Magister Kaira:<br>
We the Dark Elves believe that the more we discover hidden truth or knowledge the stronger we will become. The very thing that your tribe fears, the power of darkness, the ultimate secrets veiled under the abyss of darkness.... That is what we, the Dark Elves explore and manage without fear. That is our strength.<br>
(Quest for Dark Elven characters level 37 or above.)
