Bloody Pixy:<br>
I know what you want! You have come for the bloody fairy dust!  Do you think I would just give it to you for free?<br>
If you do me a favor, I will give you what you seek. So listen closely!<br>
Our queen is a collector of bones. She seems most happy when she is arranging the skulls of strange animals. I admit, she is a little eccentric, but she is my queen!<br>
I will give you the red fairy dust if you bring <font color="LEVEL">10 skulls</font> each, from the <font color="LEVEL">grandis, karull bugbear, Breka Orc Overlord, reto lizardman Chief</font>! I swear on this jewel!
