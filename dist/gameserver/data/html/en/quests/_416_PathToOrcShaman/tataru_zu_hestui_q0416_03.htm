Tataru Zu Hestui:<br>
If the magic of an Orc Mystic is simply to request favors of the spirits and borrow their power temporarily, Orc Shamans are those that control spirits with the authority of Paagrio. There are certain spiritual qualities that one must have to take that kind of authority into hand, and you are not of that level yet.<br>
Acknowledge your limits and go accumulate more experience. When you reach level 19, then you may return!
