Dead Leopard Body:<br>
There's a strange song coming from somewhere. At last you discover the source: it issues from the mouth of a dead leopard.

The song sounds vaguely familiar yet somehow outlandish as well, like a song you might have heard a foreigner sing as a child.

[. . . Zakar Gandi! Tejakar Leopa!

O, forgotten song, lost amid the long tribal battles!

O, my fellow warriors, once a mighty army, now scattered to the winds!]
