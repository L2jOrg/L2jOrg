Tataru Zu Hestui:<br>
Unfortunately, the language of flame cannot be explained, nor taught with common language. I cannot teach you the language, but I can tell you how to learn it.<br>
To learn the language of flame, you must meet the Hestui Totem Spirit. The spirit is a divine being, symbolizing dignity and wisdom, taking the form of a kasha bear.<br>
However, to meet it you must prepare a few things. Find and bring me the <font color="LEVEL">kasha bear pelt and kasha bladespider husk</font>, and hunt the <font color="LEVEL">scarlet salamander</font> and find the <font color="LEVEL">fiery egg.</font>
