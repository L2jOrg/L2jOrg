Priest Adonius:<br>
The precious copy of the scripture, you haven't yet given it to the person you ought to give it to. I know to some extent. That this scripture is needed to save the <font color="LEVEL">Mother Tree</font>, which is in danger of falling into the hands of our enemies right now... Don't hesitate to do what you ought to do. May the blessings of the Goddess be with you...
