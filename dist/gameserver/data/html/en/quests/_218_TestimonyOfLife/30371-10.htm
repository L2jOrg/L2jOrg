At this moment the <font color="LEVEL">Talin's Spear</font> is being transported here from <font color="LEVEL">Innadril</font>. We just have to wait until it arrives.

However it seems to me that you are rather unexperienced to use the power of the spear to its full extent. How about going for a journey of discipline while you have the time. When you feel that you are ready, come back and see me. I suppose that the <font color="LEVEL">Talin's Spear</font> will be here then, as well.
