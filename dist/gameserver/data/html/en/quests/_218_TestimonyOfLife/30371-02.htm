Thalia:<br>
Before finding the <font color="LEVEL">Water of Life</font>, we need to prepare two things ahead of time. They are the <font color="LEVEL">Grail of Purity</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Talin's Spear</font>.

</font>Talin's Spear</font> used to be kept by the Elves living in Innadril Lake, but because of the incident this time we decided to move it here.

As for you, you must find the <font color="LEVEL">Grail of Purity</font> to be used for containing the <font color="LEVEL">Water of Life</font>. This magic grail which has the power to clear all impure objects is even said to be able to purify deadly poisons such as the belladonna into clear water. The reason why we need it is because if we pour the <font color="LEVEL">Water of Life</font> in a plain vessel, it loses its strength. To preserve its strength, we need to contain it in the <font color="LEVEL">Grail of Purity</font>.
