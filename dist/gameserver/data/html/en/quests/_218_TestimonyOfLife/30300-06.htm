Blacksmith Pushkin:<br>
First I will need  a very pure, specially-made varnish to refine <font color="LEVEL">pure Mithril</font>. Using normal varnish to refine <font color="LEVEL">pure Mithril</font> will destroy it. This special varnish is derived from the secretions of giant ants.

You will find these ants in the <font color="LEVEL">Wastelands of Gludio</font>. There are hundreds of giant ants in the underground there... Kill only <font color="LEVEL">ant soldiers</font> and collect the <font color="LEVEL">liquid from their body</font> in a bottle. 20 bottles will be enough.

And last, we will need <font color="LEVEL">wyrm claws</font>. Carving a Mithril surface requires a strong and sharp knife, normal knives and chisels are not suitable. I need a chisel made from  <font color="LEVEL">wyrm claws</font>. Please get me 20 unbroken claws.

So, the 3 materials we need are: <font color="LEVEL">Pure Mithril ore</font>, <font color="LEVEL">ant soldier liquid</font> and <font color="LEVEL">wyrm claws</font>. You can remember all this, right? Good luck, Elf!
