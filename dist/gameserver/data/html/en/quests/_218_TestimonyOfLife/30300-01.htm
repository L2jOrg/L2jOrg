Blacksmith Pushkin:<br>
It's funny... You Elves used to scorn us Dwarves and think of us as inferior. And now here you are asking for help! You Elves wouldn't even know about the secrets of mithril and adamantite if you hadn't learned them from us in the ancient days. And now you brag as if those were your skills!

I do not want to help you, how will you try to persuade me?
