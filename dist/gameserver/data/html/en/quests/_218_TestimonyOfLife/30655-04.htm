You have found all of the pieces of <font color="LEVEL">Talin's spear</font>! Reassembling this will be easy for me! I studied the art of weaponry with <font color="LEVEL">Hierarch Terestian</font> of the lake fairies.

Now! Take this spear and return to <font color="LEVEL">Thalia</font>. Please find the <font color="LEVEL">Water of Life</font> so that the <font color="LEVEL">Mother Tree</font> may become green and healthy once more. May Sayha of the Winds guide you safely home...
