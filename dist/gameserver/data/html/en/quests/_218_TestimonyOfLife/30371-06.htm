Thalia:<br>
The <font color="LEVEL">Pure Mithril Cup</font>... It is indeed a masterpiece. Sometimes the Dwarves are worth themselves. To perform the ceremony of turning a Mithril Cup into a <font color="LEVEL">Grail of Purity</font>, we need <font color="LEVEL">Stardust</font>. It is the silvery powder which is said to be sprinkled by the spirits of starlight at night. The skills to gather it is handed down only among those who have now turned into Dark Elves.

Unfortunately we need the Dark Elves to obtain the Stardust. Dark Elves, our dark shadow... Although they are unforgivable creatures, in order for us to survive, and also for the survival of all the forests in this land... We need their help absolutely.

Go to the <font color="LEVEL">Dark Elves Initiation Altar</font> and meet a <font color="LEVEL">Shaman called Arkenia</font>. She knows how to make the <font color="LEVEL">Stardust</font>. I shall write you a letter. But I wonder if the hostile Dark Elves will give us help without any problems...
