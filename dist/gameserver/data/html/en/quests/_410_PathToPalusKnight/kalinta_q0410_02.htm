Kalinta:<br>
The process of making the coffin is itself a part of the trial, so you must find all the materials yourself. To make the body of the coffin, you need a <font color="LEVEL">solid carapace of a giant poison spider, and to connect the coffin, you need five thin but sturdy silk spider thread skeins.</font> If you find all these, come back to me.<br>
Giant poison spiders are fairly common, so it will be easy to find them. Trimden can be found if you follow the coastal road that lies to the south of Gludin.<br>
Accept this talisman before you leave. Those that follow Shilen will look at it and know that you are a Fighter performing the Trial of the Red Coffin. May the shelter of the abyss be with you.
