<html><head><body>Magister Khanelin: <br> Listen ... I'll tell you a story about an ancient king who received eternal life, but he paid for it, and the gods imprisoned him in a high tower. Having spent many, many years in captivity, he went mad and turned into a monster. The key to eternal life, the mountains of the treasures of the ancient empire ... and the secrets enveloping the seal ... That's what the reward of this king is. <br> (Quest is only available to characters of level 60 or higher.)</body></html>
