Sir Collin Windawood:<br>
These! Are these the bones of Leon?! I heard he died a glorious death on the battle against Orcs... What a pity... Never did I know that I would meet you again like this, my nephew! I regret that we couldn't fight in the same battlefield!<br>
Young Warrior, I give you my gratitude in the name of my family. I heard that you worked hard to recover his bones. Thank you so much. I wrote a letter in gratitude to you and the Einhasad shrine. Give this to <font color="LEVEL">Priest Dustin</font>. From now on... I shall prepare for my nephew's funeral... Whew...
