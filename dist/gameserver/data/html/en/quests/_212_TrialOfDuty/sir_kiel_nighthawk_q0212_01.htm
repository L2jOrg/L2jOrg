Sir Kiel Nighthawk:<br>
Nice to meet you, young Warrior. I am Kiel Nighthawk of the Griffon Knight union. I already received a notice from Hannavalt.<br>
One of the virtues that define a Knight's brightness is a <font color="LEVEL">sense of justice</font>. There is a miserable history in this land of Dion because of the lack of justice. Especially the unfair mortification of Sir Talianus is such a case. Sir Talianus wrote in the report about the specific situations at the peasant's uprising. It was something that he prepared to give to the King, but unfortunately the report was torn into pieces and Sir Talianus was executed. The Soldiers who served him tried to collect the torn pages but even they were all killed.<br>
Even until this day, there are some people who claim that they heard the voices of the Knight and his followers, wailing in agony. Thou who sticks to what he believed was right, but his spirits are still wandering on earth, unable to side with Shilen... I want you to carry out the justice that he couldn't complete.<br>
Gather the pieces of the report and restore the contents of his articles. As you kill the undead of the execution ground one by one, you'll be able to gather the pieces of the report. Kill the <font color="LEVEL">strains</font> and the <font color="LEVEL">ghouls</font> to collect the <font color="LEVEL">torn pieces of the report</font>. When you gather all the pieces and complete <font color="LEVEL">Talianus's Report</font> bring it back to me.
