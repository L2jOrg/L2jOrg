Priest Dustin:<br>

He was a dashing young knight, sworn to serve Einhasad's holy will and protect the innocent. He took his vow in this very temple.  He was an honorable and devout young man, nephew of the famous Sir Collin.  He was even considered for canonization by the High Priest! We all had high hopes for him, for what he might acheive for the kingdom and for the Goddess of Light... ...but alas, he has been taken from us. Oh well, it was the will of Eisenhad.<br>
