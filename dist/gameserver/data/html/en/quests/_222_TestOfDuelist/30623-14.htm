Duelist Kaien:<br>
You are quicker than I thought you were! Good, now let's see...

Hmmm...You're still short. Tired already? If you're worn out, you can quit the trial at any time. Even if you do not become a duelist, you may still be able to carve your own path... Defeats are forgotten with the passage of time... What, you don't care for the sound of that? Then don't just stand there, go and finish the trial!
