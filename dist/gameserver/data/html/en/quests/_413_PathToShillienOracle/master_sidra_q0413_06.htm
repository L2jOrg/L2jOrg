Sorceress Sidra:<br>
Before you become a Shillien Oracle that seeks the truth of all light and darkness, you must find the fragments of song that Gran Kain and Einhasad sang in the beginning.<br>
You must find two documents that have the song verses of creation written in ancient runes -- one is <font color="LEVEL">Garmiel's Book</font> and the other is <font color="LEVEL">Andariel's Book</font>.<br>
Meet <font color="LEVEL">Sorcerer Talbot in Gludin</font> to learn about Garmiel's Book. Show him this letter and he will welcome you since it is I who sent you.<br>
