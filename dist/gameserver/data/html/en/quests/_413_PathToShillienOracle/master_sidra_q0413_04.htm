Sorceress Sidra:<br>
The orb of abyss that you carry is a token that shows you have completed all requirements and are eligible to become a Shillien Oracle. Take the orb to a grand master of the Dark Elven Guild and he will change your profession. If you go to <font color="LEVEL">Grand Master Tobias</font> just over there, you can change your profession immediately.
