Mercenary Sophia:<br>
The Execution Ground is located in the eastern part of the village.  It is an eerie place where people can hear the never ending cries of dead souls.  Your mission is to clean out the undead that are infesting the place.  According to a rumor, in order to pay for the spilled blood of innocent people who were killed during the farmers uprising, the undead came back to this world... Well, all I know is that we need to carry out the given assignment.  Still, I don't feel good about this for some reason.<br>
