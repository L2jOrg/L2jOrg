Mercenary Sophia:<br>
If you really have already made up your mind, I will not hold you back any more.  Please return the Black Lion Mark.  I regret that our relationship as comrades will end from here on.  Oh, take this before you go.  This is the reward for your services you have earned until now for the mercenary troop.  Wherever you go, you can use it as seed money to establish yourself in a new place.  Well, until the day when we draw our swords together again.  Good luck brother!
