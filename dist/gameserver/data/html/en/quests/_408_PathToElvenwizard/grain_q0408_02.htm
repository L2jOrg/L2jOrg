Sorceress Greenis:<br>
I knew you would help me. The magical powers ruby contains a fiery force, and it is a precious material for those who study Elemental Magic. Our family has been producing Mystics for generations, and we all benefit from the magically powered rubies.<br>
I hope to make more of these magical powers rubies, but I am short on one material. I need down from the neck area of the pincer spider, it's called <font color="LEVEL">red down.</font>.<br>
Hunt pincer spiders and bring back five clumps of red down. Then I will give you a magical powers ruby. Here... let me give ou this. It is a talisman that I carry around for protection... It may be of some help to you.
