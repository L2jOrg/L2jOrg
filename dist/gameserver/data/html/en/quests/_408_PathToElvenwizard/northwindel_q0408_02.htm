If you want the nobility amethyst, fetch <font color="LEVEL">two regular amethysts</font> from the Underground Fortress. Defeat the <font color="LEVEL">sukar wererat leaders</font> in the Underground Fortress to obtain the amethysts. There is an old superstition that the amethyst protects one's life. That is why I think those creatures always carry it around with them.
