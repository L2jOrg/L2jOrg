Lennunt Chief Harak:<br>
Thank you for coming such a long way, messenger of the flame Monarch.

We, the lennunt tribe were dispatched to conquer Talking Island 500 years ago when war broke out with Humans. Right after the incident, we were isolated on Talking Island because the main army had retreated to the north, but we carried out the commands of the Lord with loyalty. The 'Elven School of Wizardry' of Talking Island was ruined and all its legacies had turn into ashes. Even to this day, we the Warriors of Lennunt are defending against another possible invasion by the Humans.
