Lennunt Chief Harak:<br>
My noble oak of the ancient kingdom, I have been waiting for the messenger of Paagrio Lord. Kasman, the Chief of Gludin told me that soon enough the messenger of the Monarch will visit me!

So you are the messenger? I can't believe it. <font color="LEVEL">Unless you show me the handwritten letter of the Lord...!</font>
