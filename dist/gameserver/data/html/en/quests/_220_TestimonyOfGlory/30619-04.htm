Vuku Chief Driko:<br>
Right now, I am facing a big problem which is a matter of life and death for our tribe! I have no interest in the glory of the old kingdom. Like the agreement between us, I will give you back your tribal scepter when you kill the <font color="LEVEL">drones</font> among the <font color="LEVEL">swamp stakatos</font> and bring <font color="LEVEL">30 of their husks</font>.
