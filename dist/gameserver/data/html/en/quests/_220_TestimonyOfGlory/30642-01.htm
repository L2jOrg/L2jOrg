Gandi Chief Chianta:<br>
The wind cries and the earth trembles! I see the fires of war reflected in your eyes.

The time of chaos draws nigh, and brings with it endless war, confusion, massacre and battle! I, Gandi Chief Chianta, decree this day that you must become strong in order to survive! Only the strongest shall inherit the new age!

Young Orc! I see by your necklace that you have passed Vokiyan's test and are an envoy of the Lord! Now heed my words carefully!
