Prefect Kasman:<br>
Take the letter that I gave you and meet the <font color="LEVEL">Chief of Vuku</font>! If you follow the road heading north from this village, you will be able to reach <font color="LEVEL">the army post of Turek Orcs</font>.

Keep this in mind! You are the representative of the greatest Paagrio Lord, Kakai! Always behave according to your master's pride and dignity!
