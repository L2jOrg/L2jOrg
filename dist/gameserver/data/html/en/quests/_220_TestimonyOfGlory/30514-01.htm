Prefect Vokiyan:<br>
Do you know! That all the Seers of Orcs are saying something in common! The eternal winter is approaching! It won't be long...  We Orcs are training ourselves in preparation to those days, the days of chaos and destruction, the distressed days of endless wars and disasters!

People of your tribe are weak and idle. We expect nothing from you people. The Orcs are stronger than any other tribe! We will fight against the darkness that the Age of Chaos brings along. And the victory will be ours!

(Quest for Orc characters of level 37 and above.)
