Water Undine:<br>
I am <font color="LEVEL">Undine</font>, the guardian of the deep lake, the spirit of the precious water... Did you come for the <font color="LEVEL">Tone of Water</font>?

It is the rhythm which expresses the nature of water among the 4 basic elements which the world consists of... To make one of those, you need <font color="LEVEL">20 Dazzling Drops</font> from the monsters of the marshlands.

Inpicioes which live in the <font color="LEVEL">Cruma Marshlands</font>... And the <font color="LEVEL">swamp stakatos</font> have the <font color="LEVEL">Dazzling Drops</font>. If you can bring 20 of them, I shall make you the tone. This amulet is a voucher of promise...
