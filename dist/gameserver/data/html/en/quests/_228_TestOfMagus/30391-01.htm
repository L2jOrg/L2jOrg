So you, <font color="LEVEL">Rukal</font>, heard the song as well. That's right, I've been hearing those melodies every night, recently. I've heard many songs before but I'm sure this one is no Human's voice.

It seemed like the song was coming from all different directions. And from somewhere far away... Perhaps the voice belongs to the legendary <font color="LEVEL">singing flower</font>...
