Parina:<br>
You must not be tempted by the voice of the <font color="LEVEL">singing flower</font>. They are evil creatures for sure, creatures that ought to disappear from earth. Find them and kill them. Find the <font color="LEVEL">Golden Seed</font> which bears the blood of the innocent. If you find 3 of them, take them to <font color="LEVEL">Bard Rukal</font>.
