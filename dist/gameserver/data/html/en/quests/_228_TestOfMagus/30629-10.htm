You must collect the 4 tones that correspond to the 4 elements in order to create an Absolute Tone. 

To obtain the <font color="LEVEL">Note of Water</font> You must visit the <font color="LEVEL">Water Undine</font>, a water spirit who lives in <font color="LEVEL">Fellmere Lake</font>... It is located northwest of <font color="LEVEL">Gludin</font>, north of the <font color="LEVEL">Abandonded Camp</font>.

To obtain the <font color="LEVEL">Note of Fire</font> you must seek the <font color="LEVEL">Flame Salamander</font>.  Lizard spirits such as this salamander are formed with the power of flame.  They can be found in the <font color="LEVEL">Ruins of Despair</font>, south of <font color="LEVEL">Gludio Castle Town</font>.

To locate the <font color="LEVEL">Note of Wind</font> you must meet the <font color="LEVEL">Wind Sylph</font>. She is on the northwest side of the 3 entrances to the <font color="LEVEL">Wastelands of Gludio</font>.

Last, the <font color="LEVEL">Note of Earth</font> can be obtained from the <font color="LEVEL">Earth Snake</font>. He is in the <font color="LEVEL">Ruins of Agony</font>, on the north side of <font color="LEVEL">Gludio Castle Town</font>.

I will give you a musical book in which to put the 4 notes.  When you have found them all return the book to me.
