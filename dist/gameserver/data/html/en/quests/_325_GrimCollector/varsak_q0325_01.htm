Varsak:<br>
Our family has been doing this work for generations. However, there are hardly any people who look for undertakers these days. It is because the priests of Einhasad encourage cremation. However, sometimes, there are a few who come to follow the old customs.<br>
Have you come to me for a funeral? Is there anything I can do for you?<br>
