Prefect Karukia:<br>
Very good. But do not be vain. A true Orc Marauder would regard this only as a snack. The second task is to prove your loyalty.<br>
In the Orc kingdom, we have lived many long years on the foundation of absolute obedience to our elders. However, near perfect as we are, sometimes there are betrayers that should not exist. They have fled to the Human land of Gludio to avoid our eyes. They think they are safe, but we have not forgotten them. Here are new <font color="LEVEL">reports of traitors</font>. Go on now and put an end to the traitors and prove your loyalty!<br>
When you complete this task, take the heads of the betrayers to <font color="LEVEL">Prefect Kasman in the village of Gludin</font>. If you have truly earned the qualifications to become an Orc Marauder, you can receive a token to change profession from him.
