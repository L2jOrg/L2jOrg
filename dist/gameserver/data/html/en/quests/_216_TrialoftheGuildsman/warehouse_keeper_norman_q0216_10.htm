Yes, that's the way to behave, good boy. Now I shall tell you the list of materials that you need to find. <br>
First of all we need some <font color="LEVEL">Gray Bone Powder</font> to use as the abrasive. You can get it from undead monsters such as <font color="LEVEL">ghouls</font> or <font color="LEVEL">strains</font>. I heard that there are plenty in the Execution Ground of Dion.<br>
And I also need a <font color="LEVEL">Granite Whetstone</font> which is for processing the surface of the jewel... It would be best if you can find a piece of <font color="LEVEL">granite golem</font>!<br>
Other necessary things would be... The <font color="LEVEL">Red Pigment</font>! Which you can get from the <font color="LEVEL">dead seeker</font> bat in the Execution Ground. Last, we need some <font color="LEVEL">Braided Yarn</font>. That you can get by hunting the <font color="LEVEL">silenos</font> in Giran...<br>
Can you remember everything? I need <font color="LEVEL">70 of all the above things each</font>. You said that you needed 7 Journeyman Gems, right? It takes 10 materials each per 1 jewel. Good luck then!
