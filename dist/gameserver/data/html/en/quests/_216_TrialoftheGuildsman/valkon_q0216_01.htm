Warehouse Keeper Valkon:<br>
I have been in charge of the promotion test of the Dwarf union members, for the last 10 years. Among all Dwarf apprentices, only those who pass this test are accepted as true members of the Dwarf society.  Perhaps you might not understand this well, since you are not a Dwarf, but even within our Dwarf society, there is a complex hierarchy and ranking system.<br>
