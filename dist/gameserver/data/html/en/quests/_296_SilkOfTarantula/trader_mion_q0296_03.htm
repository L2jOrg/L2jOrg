Trader Mion:<br>
Ohh! Goddess Maphr sent me a savior! Good Lord! What took you so long!<br>
You don't have much time! Now I shall tell you about collecting the spider silk. Generally, people think that tarantulas do not make webs. But that is false. They dig holes for their nests and make webs to line them! <font color="LEVEL">Hunt tarantulas and bring all the spider silk to me!</font> There are three kinds of tarantulas! <font color="LEVEL">Crimson tarantula, hunter tarantula</font> and <font color="LEVEL">plunder tarantula,</font> I remember! If you fulfill this quest, I will reward you!<br>
By the way, if you happen to find a <font color="LEVEL">tarantula spinneret</font> take it to <font color="LEVEL">Defender Nathan</font>. He will spin the silk out of it. He is a very skilled and sensitive Dwarf.
