Seer Somak:<br>
Did you receive the Urutu totem from the tribe leader?! The dreadful symbol which make the betrayers shiver and makes the blood run cold for the enemies! To receive that symbol is to be acknowledged for your capacity by the tribe leader! Have dignity while you carry the Urutu totem!
