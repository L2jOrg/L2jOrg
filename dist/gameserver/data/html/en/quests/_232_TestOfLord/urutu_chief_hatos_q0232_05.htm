Urutu Chief Hatos:<br>
The totem that you are holding in your hands is the holiest thing among the Urutu tribe, as well as a warning for the betrayers and a symbol of a resolution deeper than death! And above all, it is the mark that you have been acknowledged by I, Hatos, the Urutu tribe Chief! Do not forget the profound meaning of the 'skull with a sword stuck in it'!
