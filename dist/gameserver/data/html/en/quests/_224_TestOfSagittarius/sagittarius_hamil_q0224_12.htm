Sagittarius Hamil<br>
As time goes by, the force of  <font color="LEVEL">Commander Kadesh</font> will become stronger. If you kill the <font color="LEVEL">leto liardmen</font> which Kadesh feeds on, he will eventually turn up. Then kill him with the <font color="LEVEL">Crescent Arrow</font>. Remember what Gauen said. You must kill him with that arrow.
