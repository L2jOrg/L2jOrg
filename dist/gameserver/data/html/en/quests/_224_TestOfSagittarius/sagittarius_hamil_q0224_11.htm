Sagittarius Hamil<br>
Brankel was alive! Although I did meet him, he left for the south of Oren saying that he will buy some time while <font color="LEVEL">Commander Kadesh</font> recovers himself by eating the lizardmen. Shit!... I should have followed him!<br>
That is... The Crescent Arrow! It is the first time I have seen it since 20 years ago! Hey, take that and follow Brankel. If you kill the <font color="LEVEL">leto liardmen</font> which Kadesh feeds on, he will eventually turn up. That is when you should kill him with that arrow.<br>
