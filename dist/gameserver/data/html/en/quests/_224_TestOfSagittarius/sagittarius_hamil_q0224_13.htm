Sagittarius Hamil<br>
So you haven't been able to meet Brankel... He left in search for the heathens? He is a great man indeed. He was right. The rebirth of <font color="LEVEL">Commander Kadesh</font> must not be their final goal...<br>
Everything is apparent now with that amulet you brought. The seven eyes... This is the very mark which identifies the children of Shilen. I'd better report this to the hunter's union now. I will return this crescent's arrow to the Ivory Tower of Oren.<br>
Thank you for your trouble. You have done much more than Brankel or me in this incident.... Something terrible could have happened if it weren't for you... <br>
You are already a Sagittarius. Take this with you, this <font color="LEVEL">Mark of Sagittarius</font>. Maybe there will come a day when you and I shall hunt together.
