Blacksmith Kluto:<br>
Why have you returned so early? Were you afraid? They are only ol mahum rookies ... You are quite a timid fellow.<br>
If I may give you a piece of advice, don't go deep into the camp. If the ol mahum come upon you in a group, with your skills you'd never be able to deal with them. Do you understand what I'm saying? Well, be off now!
