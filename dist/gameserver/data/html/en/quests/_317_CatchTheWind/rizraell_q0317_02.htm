Rizraell:<br>
All spirits in the ancient forest used to be friends to us Elves. But recently, some spirits have become violent. It's as if they were trying to get revenge on the Elves for the destruction of the forest.  I heard it was the angry wind spirit 'lirein' that recently caused the strong wind to destroy the roofs of the village buildings and break windows.<br>
If the 'sylph' is the spirit of the cool breeze that blows between trees, then 'lirein' is a vengeful spirit of a wild storm. These spirits pluck trees from their roots and send animals flying high in the air. They are especially hostile to Elves. They come and go with severe winds, and we feel like they are trying to drive us from the forest. <br>
However, the 'wind shard,' a fragment of 'soul ore' that is within the body of a lirein, is a very precious resource. I make various magical products using soul ore, so I may ask you to collect some wind shards for me in the near future.<br>
