Oh, really? But aren't you here to take the test? One who has come to take a test mustn't let his mind wander to other things ... How will you take the test properly with such an attitude? I was only testing you with the story of my son ... I'm taking off points! Oh dear ...! It will be difficult to pass the test, I fear ....<br>
