I was told that the armor needed for the hunt! They said that Ol Mahum's facing hunger in the winter, so they need the armor, or they may suffer while hunting for wild boars! So, in fact, they wanted to use the armor to attack the town? I swear I did not know anything! Believe me!<br>
(Crying.) And I wanted to celebrate the conclusion of such a good contract!<br>
So, vile orcs planned to attack Gludin with Ol Mahum's... I did not leave it! I have a good idea how to destroy their plans!<br>
