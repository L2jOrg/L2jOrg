Andellia:<br>
Do you bring a message from Santiago? In search of the truth, are you?  Your timing could not be better.  <br>
I have a favor to ask you. There is a Black Priest named <font color="LEVEL">Uruha</font> in the Neutral Zone. She invaded this forest with her spirits known as <font color="LEVEL">black willow</font>. You must destroy these spirits. <br>
The black willow are located near the <font color="LEVEL">Waterfalls in the northern 
part of the Neutral Zone</font>. <font color="LEVEL">After destroying them, go 
to Uruha and warn her not to come to the Elven Forest again.</font>After you do 
this we can discuss God.
