Guard Rath:<br>
The population of lizardman on the north side of Oren is mysteriously growing. This must be related to the increase in the power of evil since the release of Antharas. There have been wild rumors of ghastly ceremonies held in the forest at night! The lizardman are most likely under the direct control of Shilen, and these rituals no doubt streng then the power of Antharas...<br>
In the midst of all this turmoil, the guild has asked me to make the roads safe for trade! No doubt they feel that their village is threatened.<br>
But this is Oren Territory, and there will be problems if we send regular troops in... The captain has ordered me to mobilize mercenaries to stabilize the area. Will you join us?<br>
