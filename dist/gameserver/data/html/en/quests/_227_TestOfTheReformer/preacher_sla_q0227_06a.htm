Preacher Sla:<br>
I made a wise decision in sending you. It might have been too difficult for Katari to manage all alone...<br>
As you know, I have one more thing that requires your help. There are some Ol Mahums who recently converted to my teachings, after being touched by my lecture on the tenet of light a few days ago. But the opposition from the church was so strong that I had to ask my pupils to shelter them in a safe place. We split them into 3 groups, and sent them to Talking Island, Orc Town of the northern region, and the Dwarven Village... But I haven't heard any news from them. I am very worried....with the recent Ol Mahum campsite incident and all... Would you go and check how they are doing for me?<br>
I'll write you 3 letters to give to my disciples.. First, go and meet Kakan. She said that she would settle down in a place southeast of Orc Town...
