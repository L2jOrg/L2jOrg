Oh... Did you say that Mother Sla sent you? Nothing's wrong except that I have been to busy these days working... Her worries were unnecessary. Never mind! Welcome! Hey! I bet on a fight with the lizardmen over there. Will you fight instead? I warn you that the competitor is really strong, though. The original challenger says he has a stomachache and he cannot fight... What do you say to it?
