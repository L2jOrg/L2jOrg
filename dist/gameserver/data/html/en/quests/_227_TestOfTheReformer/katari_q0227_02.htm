Scouts! Thank you, finally we can have some peace and quiet... What! Is that not so? I learned this while you were fighting, and much to my experience, there was a betrayer among the Ol Mahums...

...who is it!! Drat, is it him? Halt!

I am worried about the other Ol Mahums. I must go to see if my brothers are safe. Please capture that traitor! You must capture him! Understand?
