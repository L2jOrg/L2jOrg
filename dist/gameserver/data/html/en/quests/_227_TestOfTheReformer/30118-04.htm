Priestess Rupino:<br>
It is an honor to meet a person who has the same thoughts as me... I suppose those who are enlightened will worry such worries. You are prohibited to speak out such stories, though... Those are taboo and are not allowed in here...

I will give you this book. Read it when you have the time. But first, go to the execution place of Dion. Perhaps it might help you to find the answers to some of your questions... Knock off the <font color="LEVEL">anonymous spirits</font> wandering around the execution place. The only thing that you should keep in mind is that you must hit the last strike, with the magic of disrupt undead.
