Summoner Brynthea<br>
How do you do, apprenticeship Summoner? My name is Brynthea, a Summoner like you. That thing over there is my lovely servant, silhouette Tilfo.<br>
I suppose you came here to challenge me? Here, this is my Arcana Card... It is a masterpiece made by ordering a Dwarf slave. Ain't that a beauty? I shall give you this card if you win. ...So, I guess you are about to say something now?<br>
