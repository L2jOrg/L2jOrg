High Summoner Galatea:<br>
In the old days Summoners created their own cards, but the cards have become so sophisticated that they must be created by Craftsmen. You are not yet an official Summoner and may only receive <font color="LEVEL">apprentice Arcana Cards</font>. Perhaps the day will come when you possess a 'Major Arcana Card,' a card that is only held by the top Summoners of the land!<br>
The card you will be making now is for use in the trial, so it need not be ostentatious. You must seek out a Craftsman that knows the method of creating Arcana Cards. <font color="LEVEL">Trader Lars of the Town of Dion</font> will probably make a card for you.<br>
He works rather slowly, so I suggest that you order a good supply of them.<br>
