Ouch! Unicorn Pantersm! Oh no... I hope that he isn't badly hurt!<br>
Wow, that was something. I never knew you would make it with such a poor animal! We lost this time. Take <font color="LEVEL">my Arcana Card that I had promised</font>. But this will be the first and last time I lose to you. Take good care of it until our next match.
