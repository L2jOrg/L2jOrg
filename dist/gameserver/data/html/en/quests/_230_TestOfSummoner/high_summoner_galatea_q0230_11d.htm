High Summoner Galatea:<br>
I have several ideas for potential opponents for you.<br>
First of all, you should try <font color="LEVEL">Summoner Almors</font>.  His has been sick lately and is recovering on <font color="LEVEL">Talking Island</font>. <br>
You should try <font color="LEVEL">Summoner Basillia</font>.  I have heard that she is busy researching a new form of Summoning magic nearby a farm on <font color="LEVEL">the southern shores of Gludio</font>.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Summoner Carmoniell</font> of the Elves has been in seclusion in a <font color="LEVEL">cottage in southern Dion</font>. I've heard he has had some trouble lately. <br>
<font color="LEVEL">Summoner Celestiel</font> usually resides in the Ivory Tower, but has returned to <font color="LEVEL">the Elven Woods</font> on urgent business from the homeland.<br>
The Dark Elves <font color="LEVEL">Summoner Brynthea</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Summoner Belthus</font> are proper opponents for you, but they are hard to find, as they are not likely to stay in one place. Last I heard, Brynthea was somewhere in the <font color="LEVEL">northeastern parts of Giran</font>, and Belthus was somewhere in the <font color="LEVEL">Cruma marshlands</font>...<br>
These Summoners are all proud and haughty people, and may scoff at a challenge from an apprentice Summoner like yourself, but they will likely accept the challenge, even if it is merely to display their supremacy.
