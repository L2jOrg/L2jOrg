Alex:<br>
Welcome, my friend.  If Master Luther sent you here you must be ready to get to work.  <br>
Floran Village needs more good workers like you. We don't have a guard or even a single skilled person!<br>
I have been waiting for you since I received the warrant of appointment.  Take this and give it to my adjutant <font color="LEVEL">Militia Leirynn</font>... <br>
She is a modest lady. I am afraid that work here may not be as easy as you think... I thank you in advance.<br>
