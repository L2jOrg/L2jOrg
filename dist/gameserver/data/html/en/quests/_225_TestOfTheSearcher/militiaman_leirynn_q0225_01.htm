Militiaman Leirynn:<br>
Welcome. Recently a lot of delu lizardmen are gathering together. I guess that they are watching for a town with a weak defense. The villagers are relying heavily on us, it makes me anxious that we don't know a way to escape it either... We are relatively weak compared to them so our only choice is the guerilla tactic...<br>
I know it must be too sudden for you, but please find the <font color="LEVEL">delu lizardmen's shaman</font> and get rid of them. They say that there are <font color="LEVEL">10</font> of them all together.
