Master Luther:<br>
Did you come for the Mark of  the Searcher? The Mark is given to those who's ability for 'finding hidden things' is recognized. Every year, numerous Hunters, Scouts, Excavators and even some Assassins come to me in hope of receiving the <font color="LEVEL">Test of the Searcher</font> though you don't seem like one of them... Are you sure I am the right person you are looking for?<br>
(Quest only available for Human Rogue, Elven Ranger, Assassin, or Raider above level 39.)
