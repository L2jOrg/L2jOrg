Ha ha! I guess that Alex didn't want to let you go. At the end of the recommendation letter he wrote jestingly that he would like me to come up with a fault and send you back to him. I am already aware of the story that you have won back Baron Ashton's gold from the delu lizardmen. I guess that it was quite interesting for you, am I right?<br>
What do you think? How about going back to Alex as he had suggested? Ha ha! It was a joke. Here, take it! It is the <font color="LEVEL">Mark of the Searcher</font>. Thank you for the good job you have done!
