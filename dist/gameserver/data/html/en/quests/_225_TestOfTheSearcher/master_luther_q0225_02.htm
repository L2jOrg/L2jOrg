Master Luther:<br>
Did you come for the Mark of the Searcher? The Searcher's Mark is given to those who's ability for 'finding hidden things' is recognized. Every year, numerous Hunters, Scouts, Excavators and even some Assassins come to me in hope of receiving the <font color="LEVEL">'Test of the Searcher'</font> but I don't think that you are experienced enough to take the examination. Come back after you have improved your abilities.<br>
(Quest only available for Rogue, Elven Ranger, Assassin, or Raider above level 39.)
