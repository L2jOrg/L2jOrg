Grand Master Oltlin:<br>
Have you seen the sights of the city? The wonderful castles built by humans, in spite of countless errors and obstacles. Do you have any idea what is beneath them? Often, long shadows are cast under the glow of glory.<br>
You always find the darkest shadows under strong light.  Those who pursue glory are wary of shadows. Where there is pure achievement, there is always absence.<br>
