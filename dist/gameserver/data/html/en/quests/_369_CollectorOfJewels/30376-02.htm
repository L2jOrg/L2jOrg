Magister Nell:<br>
Do you wish to hear my story? Sometime ago, I met a Wiseman. He told me that the Forgotten Temple is related to the Ruins on Talking Island.

More than anything else, this glittering Flare Shard and Freezing Shard are the proof! They are fragments of elemental stone found in the Ruins of Talking Island and the Forgotten Temple! Before they were broken, these two elemental stones must have had mutual resonance.

Would you help me? Please go to the temple and bring me more of these gemstones.
