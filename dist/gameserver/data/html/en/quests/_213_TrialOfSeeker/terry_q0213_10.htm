Master Terry:<br>
Take this letter and see <font color="LEVEL">Viktor of the Hunter's Village</font>. The bezoars are in this box. Take them also to Viktor.<br>
You can call him an expert on such investigations. Back then, when I was called the Hawk Eye, he used to be called as the clairvoyant and was well known for being the best source provider, even continuing to this day. If it were him, I am sure he'll be able to find something out from the bezoars. I heard that he owns a shop, at the moment... How unlikely of him, really.<br>
Anyway, take this letter with you. If you tell him that you were sent by the Hawk Eye, he will talk to you. If he pretends not to understand, say <font color="LEVEL">'Altebar Karryos'</font> out loud. That's my real name. By the way, he never did anything for free... So, he might ask you for something. In that case, I'll leave it up to you.<br>
I expect you to do your best!
