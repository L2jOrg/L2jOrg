Thank you. It's not too difficult. A few days ago I ordered a special thing from the Blacksmith in the Dwarven Village. But I was too busy to go and fetch it back. Please go and fetch it for me. It's not too difficult.<br>
Oh, I almost forgot to tell you the name... He is <font color="LEVEL">Mr. Bronp the Blacksmith of the Dwarven Village</font>. Thank you, for your help.
