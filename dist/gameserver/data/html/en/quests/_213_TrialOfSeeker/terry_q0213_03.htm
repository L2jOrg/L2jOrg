Master Terry:<br>
Let's start with one living close to this town. I guess that narrows it down to <font color="LEVEL">Neer Crawler Prek</font>. If you go to the east execution ground, you'll be able to find many neer crawlers. Among them there will be one called <font color="LEVEL">Neer Crawler Prek</font>. Catch him.<br>
And once you get hold of him, see if you can find anything extraordinary. If there is anything at all, come back to me right away.
