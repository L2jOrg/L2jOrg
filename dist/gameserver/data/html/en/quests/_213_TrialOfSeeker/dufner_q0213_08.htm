Hey, that's Eagle Eye Terry's report! Let me have a look. Hmm...children of Shilen! My my! Have they finally decided to break their silence?<br>
Well, you have done very well. Our guild will take it from here. Thank you for your trouble. Oh, and I see that Terry has also written a letter commending your skills. You are more that qualified to receive this Mark of the Scout from our guild.<br>
Your efforts have been rewarded! I wish you the best of luck in the future. Good work.
