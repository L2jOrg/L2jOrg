Father Gupu:<br>
Thank you so much. Wendy has just returned! She must be inside washing up!

Wendy! You little rascal! Do you know how worried I was?! Pull one more stunt like that, and you'll get a spanking you will never forget!

Young man, thank you for finding this child. Making a donation and finding a lost child... We are truly in your debt. 

Oh yes, by the way, Wendy asked me to give this to you. It looks like a trinket that she picked up while playing in the Wastelands...
