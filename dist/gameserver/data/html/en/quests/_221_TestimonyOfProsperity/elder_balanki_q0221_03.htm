Elder Balanki:<br>
Ah, Mion... So rich, but always late with guild payments. This is not the first time this has happened. He ignores his obligations on purpose. He must be taught a lesson! I see you have received Maryse Redbonnet's dues. I thought he was so blinded by revenge that he couldn't see anything else.  At least he knows how to pay. <br>
Many thanks for your troubles! Here is the <font color="LEVEL">receipt</font>. Take this to the First Elder.
