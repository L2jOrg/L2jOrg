Warehouse Keeper Parman:<br>
You are already getting lazy after passing the member's trial! You, shouldn't you start preparing to be an upper level member of the union? How about a Master Raider or a Warsmith?<br>
What do you think? Does that interest you? Keep this in mind. In order to be an upper level member, you must pass the <font color="LEVEL">Test of Prosperity</font>. It is no match to the member's trial. You are too inexperienced to take this test yet. Come back after you have gathered more experience. Then I shall tell you in detail about the test.<br>
(Quest for Dwarven characters of level 37 and above.)
