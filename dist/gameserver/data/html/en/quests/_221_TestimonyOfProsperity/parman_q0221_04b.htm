Warehouse Keeper Parman:<br>
If you go <font color="LEVEL">northwest of Gludio</font> there is a farmer who sews the seeds and cultivates the land despite the rampage the Orcs are making. His name is <font color="LEVEL">Peter</font> by the way? You'd better go and ask him about the <font color="LEVEL">Token of the Fertile Lands</font> since he is the man who cultivated the Wastelands which everybody abandoned.<br>
