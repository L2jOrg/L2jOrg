Elder Arin:<br>
Please. Go and bring back Master Toma's guild dues. I'm sure he's forgotten that they are due.... He is quite the traveler, you know... Some say that he has been spotted in the <font color="LEVEL">abandoned mines east of the village</font>, while others say he is at the <font color="LEVEL">far east region of the Dwarven kingdom</font>, and still others say that he was seen fishing near the <font color="LEVEL">northern shores</font>...
