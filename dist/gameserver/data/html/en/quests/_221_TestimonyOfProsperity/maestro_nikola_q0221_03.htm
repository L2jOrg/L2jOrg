Maestro Nikola:<br>
Well, actually the decoding of the Giant's characters is only allowed by the Elders of the guild. They never teach anyone the methods of decoding the Giant's characters. Therefore, nobody should recognize that I noticed the Giant's characters right away. As for me, I learned the methods in a secret way, as well. And it's not perfect anyway. I don't know what the Elders have in mind...<br>
Anyway, as soon as I saw the stone, I could tell right away that <font color="LEVEL">Maphr's Tablet Fragments</font> were hidden in the box. At that moment, I heard roars from the creatures upstairs and downstairs. I had no choice but to run away immediately. As I said earlier, I am not an expert in this area, so if the creatures attack it is most likely that I will get killed.<br>
It has already been a week since, and still I have not been able to enter the tower. But I am not completely empty handed. I learned that it is impossible the open the box by force. There must be a <font color="LEVEL">special key</font> to open the box. I also did a sound research on the materials and methods to make the key. I assure you that I can make the key to open the box!<br>
