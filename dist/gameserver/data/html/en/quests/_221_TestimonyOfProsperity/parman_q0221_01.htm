Warehouse Keeper Parman:<br>
Do you know? That Dwarves like me are all members of a union? And that you must pass a severe test to be a upper class member? You must not think that being a member of the union is an easy life, just because we are always smiling. Even within the Dwarf society, there is fierce competition,and never ending challenge in order to survive.<br>
