Warehouse Keeper Parman:<br>
Maphr's Tablet is said to be recorded in the Giants' characters. But we <font color="LEVEL">Dwarfs are the true owners of the tablet</font>. Because it was the Dwarfs who learnt directly from Maphr and until this day, we are retaining the tradition in manufacturing, trading, and architecture! Other races who are ignorant about math, dynamics, measurement and architecture won't even be able to follow the basics of absolute geometry.<br>
That is why obtaining Maphr's Tablet has been our greatest wish and long cherished dream. If only we can recover the secrets of absolute geometry, not only will we be able to rebuild our kingdom of Dwarves, but also obtain the power to control the entire continent. The world which functions according to principle and reason, the world where everything runs smoothly like a well-greased cogwheel...That is the picture of our ideal heaven which we will make with our own 2 hands.<br>
But unfortunately, they say that Maphr's Tablet isn't in good condition. According to the legend, when the war between the Gods and the Giants broke out, Gods who were afraid that the Giants will get hold of the almighty power, split the stone slate of Maphr into a dozen pieces and spread it all over the world. They say that even the Gods were afraid of its consequences so you can imagine its power.<br>
