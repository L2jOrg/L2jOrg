Arhh... I know that I have to make a<font color="LEVEL">donation</font>. However... However... My sales are not doing well these days. What shall I do? Tell me, what shall I do? Can't you pay it instead of me? I guess that is not possible, right? What should I do...<br>
Ok, then I'll just have to borrow some money for the donation... It was the money I borrowed and I was planning to use for buying the products to sell in my shop.... Take it. Here you go.<br>
Phew!. What do I live on from now? Oh dear. What shall I do?
