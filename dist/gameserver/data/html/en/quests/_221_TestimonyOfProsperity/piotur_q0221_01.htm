Peter:<br>
The land around here used to be fertile farmlands before the terrible war with Gracia. It was a peaceful place where simple farmers like myself tilled the land to make a living. When we tilled the land earnestly, mother earth would reward us with a rich harvest. <br>
But, because of the war, all the farms were burned down and the earth was devastated. Moreover, a group of Orcs has invaded our land and have settled here. Fertile lands... Gludio's best granary... Those are stories from long ago, but a memory now...  <br>
