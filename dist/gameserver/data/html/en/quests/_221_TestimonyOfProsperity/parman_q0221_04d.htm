Warehouse Keeper Parman:<br>
This is the story that I heard from Wilfred the Warehouse Keeper of Talking Island. It is said that there is an Elf who has been <font color="LEVEL">waiting for his lover to come back for 1,000 years</font>. Isn't that amazing? That he lived for one thousand years. It reminded me of him when we were talking about <font color="LEVEL">health</font>. <br>
Aren't you curious? How he could live for such a long time? Even though the life span of an Elf is much longer than that of any other, I have heard of no Elf that could live for 1,000 years before. Anyway, go to the <font color="LEVEL">Warehouse Keeper Wilfred of Talking Island </font> and ask him about the Elf that lived for more than a thousand years.<br>
