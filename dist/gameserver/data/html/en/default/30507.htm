Priest Racoy:
<br>Only the Flame of the Abyss endures forever!<br>That is why you mustn't allow yourself to be distracted by trivialities or lured off the path of true knowledge! Self-discipline. Yes, self-discipline is the most fundamental skill to master, the one from which all others flow. Remember my words!<br>
