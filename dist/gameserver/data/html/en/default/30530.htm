<br>
Welcome. I want to give you one task. Gremlin's met in the vicinity? These bastards have stolen the precious blue gem, and fled.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Your task - to find him. To return the gem, you need to hunt for the Gremlin\s.</font><br>
Hover over the Gremlin and press the <font color="FF0000">left button</font>. The cursor changes to a sword. With the change of the cursor click the left mouse button and attack.<img src="L2UI_CH3.tutorial_img12" width=64 height=64><br>
When you're done with it, I'll give you something useful as a gift. So, good luck.<br>
