Priest Cerenas:<br>
Greetings, traveler! May the peace of the lake and blessing of the light be with you!<br>
As for me, I come from another place. I came here to gain experience. They say the teachings cannot be understood to the full extent. Someday, I will leave this place to be there for those who need my help. But this day hasn't come yet. Actually, I'm still have a long way to go. So don't worry.<Button ALIGN=LEFT ICON="QUEST" action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest</Button>
