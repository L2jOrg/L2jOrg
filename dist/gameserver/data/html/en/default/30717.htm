I am depressed by the things that are going on in this tower. How can the things people strive for differ, if they walk the same road... The Grand Masters all say that chaos is eminent. This chaos will only be restored by cooperation between hostile races, I am certain...<br>
I do have good news, the purification process of the Sea of Spores is being done by Human and Elves. If things like this continue, trust will build and become a valuable treasure.<br>
