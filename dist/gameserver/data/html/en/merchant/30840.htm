Trader Lorenzo: <br>
Hm, lately there have been rumors about a limited opening of a border with Elmore, but it's not clear whether it's misheard talks from bigwigs or they're going to tighten the screws even more instead... <br>
You see, my brother moved to Elmore hoping to start a trading business there... And I'm worried that I won't be able to see him again even once. <br>
