<html><body>Gatekeeper Merian:
<br>
This is as far up as you're allowed to go in the Ivory Tower. Heh, it's kind of hard to tell where you are because you've moved through gates... You're currently on the 4th floor, the Dark Elf Guild is located here. The floor above is not open to the general public.<br>
Which floor would you like to go down to?<br>

<Button ALIGN=LEFT ICON="QUEST" action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest</button>
