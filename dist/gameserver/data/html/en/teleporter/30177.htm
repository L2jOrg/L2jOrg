Gatekeeper Valentina:<br>
Hello! I am Gatekeeper Valentina, I teleport from the Ivory Tower. Many believe that Tower residents harbor the plans of world domination and call this place a nest of madmen. But nobody thinks that here live people who try to make our world a better place...<br>
Do you have any questions about the Tower? You've chosen the best gatekeeper after all! Ha!<br>
