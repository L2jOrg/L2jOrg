Head Blacksmith Ferris:<br>
Aden Town used to be a teaming hub of blacksmith activities, especially during the war with Elmore always hovering on the horizon. Why in those days, ol' Tapoy of the Black Anvil Guild made a killing. He was able to retire in style. Bought a cute little cabin out by a lake and set up his own personal forge. Now that's the life!<br>
I thought that when wars were finally over I'd have some time to pursue my other interests, like knitting and free climbing, but I've been busier than ever lately. Sigh.<br>
