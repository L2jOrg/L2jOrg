Grand Master Xenos:<br>
To take the Test of the Dark Wizard, you'll have to find the <font color="LEVEL">Shamaness Varika</font> in the Dark Forest. To change profession, you must pass the test she gives and bring back the <font color="LEVEL">Jewel of Darkness</font> as a token. She stays at the <font color="LEVEL">altar</font> of the Dark Forest.<br>
To get to the altar, take the road north. Then you will come to the Dark Forest. Enter the forest and go down the road until you come to a road that forks to the east. Take that road until you arrive at the altar.<br>
