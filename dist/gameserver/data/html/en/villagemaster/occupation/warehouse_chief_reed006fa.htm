Warehouse Chief Reed:<br>
Dwarven <font color="LEVEL">Scavengers</font> are skilled in collecting raw materials, while <font color="LEVEL">Artisans</font> are able to craft something valuable from those materials. A Scavenger needs above-average physical strength and combat abilities to successfully brave the dangers of collecting even the rarest of material.<br>
The most talented Scavengers are selected to become <font color="LEVEL">Bounty Hunters</font>, who are capable of recovering powerful arcane items like Dragon Scales.<br>
