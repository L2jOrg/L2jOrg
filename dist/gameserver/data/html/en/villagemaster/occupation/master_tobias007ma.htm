Grand Master Tobias: <br>
<font color="LEVEL">Dark Wizards</font> are merely advanced Dark Mystics. They've mastered the  power to control awesome spirits, and use Elemental, Dark and Summoning Magic. <br>
Dark Wizards may advance to become <font color="LEVEL">Spellhowlers</font>, specializing in Elemental Magic, or <font color="LEVEL">Phantom Summoners</font>, taking their studies of Summoning Magic to the next level. <br>
Anyone wishing to advance to this class must have achieved at least level 20 and proven themselves by bringing me the <font color="LEVEL">Jewel of Darkness</font>. <br>
