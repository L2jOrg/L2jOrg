Grand Master Tobias:<br>
To take the Test of the Dark Wizard, you'll have to find the <font color="LEVEL">Shamaness Varika</font> in the Dark Forest. To change profession, you must pass the test she gives and bring back the <font color="LEVEL">Jewel of Darkness</font> as a token. She stays at the <font color="LEVEL">altar</font> of the Dark Forest.<br>
To get to the altar, follow the road to the northwest and cross the Neutral Zone. Enter the Dark Forest and turn left, and keep going until you come to a road to the south.<br>
