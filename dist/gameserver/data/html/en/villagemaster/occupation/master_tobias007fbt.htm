The <font color="LEVEL">Iron Heart</font> is only given to those who pass the Test of the Assassin. It attests that you have met the qualifications to be an Assassin. The Test of the Assassin is given by <font color="LEVEL">Triskel</font>. You can change profession after you pass his test and bring back the <font color="LEVEL">Iron Heart</font> as proof. <font color="LEVEL">Triskel</font> is always near our guild, so you will easily find him nearby once you get there.<br>
