Warehouse Chief Klump:<br>
Pleased to meet you. I am Warehouse Chief Klump of the Steel Door Guild. Giran is the center of our craft, of course, but the river of wealth that flows to us here in Aden Castle Town is scarcely less deep. Of course, here we focus more on decorative and artistic pieces rather than everyday items.<br>
